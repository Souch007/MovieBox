1
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.300
<i>This marks the end</i>

2
00:01:30.383 --> 00:01:34.095
<i>of a long and painful chapter
for the people of Libya,</i>

3
00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:37.766
<i>who now have the opportunity
to determine their own destiny</i>

4
00:01:38.016 --> 00:01:40.602
<i>in a new and democratic Libya.</i>

5
00:01:45.607 --> 00:01:47.484
<i>Warring gangs continue to raid</i>

6
00:01:47.567 --> 00:01:49.152
<i>Gaddafi's abandoned armories</i>

7
00:01:49.235 --> 00:01:51.696
<i>as a battle rages in Libya's
two largest cities.</i>

8
00:04:19.886 --> 00:04:21.220
It's loaded.

9
00:04:22.347 --> 00:04:24.223
- How's the team here?
- Good.

10
00:04:24.307 --> 00:04:25.892
3 ex-Marines, one ex-Army Ranger.

11
00:04:26.601 --> 00:04:28.519
It's nice having another team guy around.

12
00:04:31.022 --> 00:04:32.065
Good to see you, brother.

13
00:04:33.316 --> 00:04:34.943
Good to be back.

14
00:04:35.401 --> 00:04:37.111
Oh, man, it's hot!

15
00:04:48.748 --> 00:04:49.791
<i>How are the kids, Jack?</i>

16
00:04:49.916 --> 00:04:50.917
<i>They're good.</i>

17
00:04:51.626 --> 00:04:53.294
They send their love.

18
00:04:53.628 --> 00:04:55.668
Can you believe Emily's
about to start kindergarten?

19
00:04:55.964 --> 00:04:57.131
She dating yet?

20
00:04:57.256 --> 00:04:59.092
You better watch your mouth.

21
00:04:59.926 --> 00:05:02.178
I thank God
I got three boys, man.

22
00:05:02.345 --> 00:05:03.471
You're in for a rough ride, Jack.

23
00:05:03.554 --> 00:05:05.598
Payback's a bitch
and her stripper name is Karma.

24
00:05:06.057 --> 00:05:07.725
You come up with
that on your own?

25
00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:09.089
I saw it on a T-shirt in Mexico.

26
00:05:10.645 --> 00:05:12.146
Hey, check this out.

27
00:05:13.481 --> 00:05:15.650
Remnants of the revolution, man.

28
00:05:17.735 --> 00:05:20.738
Is Becky still mad at me
for dragging you into contracting?

29
00:05:20.905 --> 00:05:22.991
Oh, come on.
She's mad at me, she's not mad at you.

30
00:05:24.325 --> 00:05:26.661
I'm part of the old crowd, the old Jack.

31
00:05:26.744 --> 00:05:29.247
The new Jack
carries a diaper bag instead of an M4.

32
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:30.832
Is this coming from Tyrone Woods,

33
00:05:30.957 --> 00:05:32.437
dental nurse, who works for his wife?

34
00:05:34.002 --> 00:05:36.170
Guess what?
Not out here, brother.

35
00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:37.880
How's the real estate business?

36
00:05:38.548 --> 00:05:39.716
Pretty bad.

37
00:05:40.466 --> 00:05:41.718
How bad is that?

38
00:05:41.843 --> 00:05:43.094
I'm here, aren't I?

39
00:05:43.428 --> 00:05:45.680
Well, this place sucks, Jack.
Not only is it hot as balls,

40
00:05:45.763 --> 00:05:48.099
but you can't tell the
good guys from the bad guys.

41
00:05:55.273 --> 00:05:58.443
Shit. No, no, no, this isn't good.

42
00:06:02.363 --> 00:06:03.364
Fuck!

43
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:06.534
Who the fuck are these guys?

44
00:06:06.617 --> 00:06:07.910
What do we got?

45
00:06:08.786 --> 00:06:12.623
The brigade we coordinate with
is the February 17th Martyrs.

46
00:06:12.832 --> 00:06:13.916
This ain't them.

47
00:06:18.588 --> 00:06:19.672
Shit, we're boxed in.

48
00:06:25.053 --> 00:06:26.387
Are we bailing?

49
00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:29.557
Base, this is Rone.

50
00:06:29.724 --> 00:06:31.225
This is Rone. Come in. Over.

51
00:06:31.434 --> 00:06:32.434
This is base. Go, Rone.

52
00:06:32.477 --> 00:06:33.686
<i>I'm in a jam
off Fifth Ring Road.</i>

53
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.104
I'm looking at about
8 armed Tangos here.

54
00:06:35.396 --> 00:06:36.814
<i>Copy that. Sit tight.</i>

55
00:06:36.898 --> 00:06:39.067
"Sit tight." That's great advice.

56
00:06:40.401 --> 00:06:41.694
They got a KPV.

57
00:06:42.153 --> 00:06:43.988
Base, we ain't got all day.

58
00:06:44.155 --> 00:06:45.915
<i>Hey, Rone. They're
trying to get Feb 17</i>

59
00:06:46.032 --> 00:06:47.742
<i>to back you up, but we're coming.</i>

60
00:06:48.326 --> 00:06:49.994
Hey, Oz, I'm in a jam off Fifth Ring.

61
00:06:50.078 --> 00:06:51.162
Ty.

62
00:06:52.914 --> 00:06:55.249
Rone, 17 Feb QRF is being alerted.

63
00:06:55.458 --> 00:06:56.458
Fuck that.

64
00:06:56.501 --> 00:06:58.381
The only Quick Reaction Force
I want is my guys.

65
00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:00.505
No. Contact 17 Feb QRF.

66
00:07:00.713 --> 00:07:02.073
<i>Send them! I want my guys.</i>

67
00:07:02.215 --> 00:07:04.258
Tell them they're not allowed
to leave the base.

68
00:07:04.342 --> 00:07:05.802
Negative, Rone. Just hang in there.

69
00:07:05.968 --> 00:07:07.637
Maybe I'm not making myself clear.

70
00:07:07.804 --> 00:07:11.265
I'm looking at multiple radical insurgents
with AK's and a.50-cal technical

71
00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:13.935
set to blow my Rover
all the way back to Zimbabwe. Over.

72
00:07:14.018 --> 00:07:15.103
It's not my call, brother.

73
00:07:18.856 --> 00:07:20.525
Here we go.

74
00:07:21.943 --> 00:07:23.277
Welcome to Benghazi.

75
00:07:27.532 --> 00:07:28.741
<i>Salaam.</i>

76
00:07:30.034 --> 00:07:31.369
Libyan visa.

77
00:07:32.078 --> 00:07:33.746
Official. Libyan government.

78
00:07:34.413 --> 00:07:35.998
Friendly? Hmm? Friendly?

79
00:07:36.791 --> 00:07:38.626
Pull over for inspection.

80
00:07:40.086 --> 00:07:41.087
No.

81
00:07:41.712 --> 00:07:43.381
Pull over for inspection!

82
00:07:43.464 --> 00:07:44.882
I'm sorry, sir, I can't do that.

83
00:07:53.391 --> 00:07:54.392
Look up.

84
00:07:55.226 --> 00:07:57.895
Go ahead, look up. You see the drone?

85
00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.899
No? That's all right,
because the drone sees you.

86
00:08:02.567 --> 00:08:03.901
Sees your face.

87
00:08:04.318 --> 00:08:05.820
We know who you are.

88
00:08:06.404 --> 00:08:08.656
If anything happens to us, your home,

89
00:08:08.739 --> 00:08:11.159
your family, boom, gone.

90
00:08:11.367 --> 00:08:12.869
Give the order to let us go.

91
00:08:12.994 --> 00:08:14.162
I want the car!

92
00:08:15.413 --> 00:08:17.039
No, I'm not gonna do that.

93
00:08:17.165 --> 00:08:18.166
Look,

94
00:08:18.583 --> 00:08:21.252
I earn right to decide
the future of my country.

95
00:08:21.377 --> 00:08:22.503
You're talking to the wrong guy.

96
00:08:22.587 --> 00:08:25.339
How willing are you to die
for your country?

97
00:08:25.756 --> 00:08:27.508
I'm ready to go, right here, right now.

98
00:08:38.102 --> 00:08:40.479
Leave here while you still can.

99
00:08:57.246 --> 00:08:58.748
We got air support?

100
00:08:59.624 --> 00:09:01.375
We don't have any fucking support.

101
00:09:18.017 --> 00:09:20.102
Check the new rides. Gaddafi had
a going-out-of-business sale

102
00:09:20.186 --> 00:09:21.312
on armored vehicles.

103
00:09:22.021 --> 00:09:24.398
Max-level armored, man.

104
00:09:24.482 --> 00:09:26.150
We got a great deal.

105
00:09:26.442 --> 00:09:27.944
We stole them.

106
00:09:29.528 --> 00:09:31.530
Sat unattended at the airport.

107
00:09:33.074 --> 00:09:34.075
Hey, Chief!

108
00:09:34.659 --> 00:09:36.244
I don't want to hear it, Tyrone.

109
00:09:36.327 --> 00:09:38.329
Oh, no, no, I understand.

110
00:09:38.663 --> 00:09:40.248
I see what you're going for here.

111
00:09:40.331 --> 00:09:43.584
Secret spy base
with fortified walls, gate cameras,

112
00:09:43.751 --> 00:09:44.919
and blue-eyed Westerners

113
00:09:45.002 --> 00:09:46.802
walking in and out
of this place all day long.

114
00:09:46.921 --> 00:09:48.547
But if you want to avoid...

115
00:09:48.631 --> 00:09:49.757
That's so rude.

116
00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.717
Can't believe he just did that to me.

117
00:09:53.761 --> 00:09:55.638
Chief, if you want to avoid
an international incident,

118
00:09:55.721 --> 00:09:57.765
you give me my guys
when I ask for them!

119
00:09:57.848 --> 00:10:00.268
Local faces need to resolve
local conflicts, Tyrone.

120
00:10:00.351 --> 00:10:01.852
We're guests in this country.

121
00:10:02.353 --> 00:10:03.688
We're unwanted guests, Bob.

122
00:10:03.771 --> 00:10:05.606
We're spies,
you're security guards.

123
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:08.359
Your job is to keep us out of trouble,
not get into it yourselves.

124
00:10:08.526 --> 00:10:11.028
Well, then help me do my job
and give me my guys.

125
00:10:11.112 --> 00:10:12.530
Here's what you guys are good at.

126
00:10:12.613 --> 00:10:15.199
Working out, eating 5 hot meals a day.

127
00:10:15.574 --> 00:10:18.577
What you're not so good at
is doing what you're told.

128
00:10:18.744 --> 00:10:21.872
Uh, I need your trace report
on yellowcake in 5 minutes.

129
00:10:22.373 --> 00:10:23.457
It's coming.

130
00:10:23.541 --> 00:10:26.043
That roadblock
was run by Ansar Al-Sharia.

131
00:10:26.294 --> 00:10:29.088
It's not just tribal groups
and freedom fighters anymore.

132
00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.674
If you have useful Intel,
Tyrone, put it in a memo.

133
00:10:32.216 --> 00:10:34.093
You guys bunk here,

134
00:10:34.885 --> 00:10:36.387
but you're not CIA.

135
00:10:36.887 --> 00:10:38.389
You're hired help.

136
00:10:38.723 --> 00:10:39.974
Act the part.

137
00:10:41.225 --> 00:10:42.225
Where are my manners?

138
00:10:42.268 --> 00:10:44.228
Jack Silva, this is our
esteemed Chief of Station.

139
00:10:44.312 --> 00:10:46.063
Hey, Tig. How are the twins?

140
00:10:46.147 --> 00:10:47.398
- Crazy cute.
- Cute.

141
00:10:47.815 --> 00:10:49.150
You have a move tonight.

142
00:10:49.275 --> 00:10:50.651
No recon, Chief?

143
00:10:51.068 --> 00:10:53.112
What makes you
Special Operators so special

144
00:10:53.237 --> 00:10:55.531
if you can't do what I need
when I need it?

145
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:00.911
He's fun.

146
00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:03.497
Well, that was fun.

147
00:11:03.956 --> 00:11:06.959
He gets his jollies
pushing around alphas because he can.

148
00:11:07.335 --> 00:11:09.420
We had this commander
back in Ranger school,

149
00:11:09.503 --> 00:11:11.005
he was a real cockbag.

150
00:11:11.422 --> 00:11:14.675
So on our last night, me and a buddy,
we stole his beret.

151
00:11:15.009 --> 00:11:16.761
The whole barracks chubbed it.

152
00:11:16.844 --> 00:11:18.929
- "Chubbed it"?
- Yeah, rubbed our dicks on it.

153
00:11:20.598 --> 00:11:22.892
Leader was a former Gitmo detainee.

154
00:11:22.975 --> 00:11:24.735
Yeah, those guys
usually don't hold a grudge.

155
00:11:24.852 --> 00:11:26.854
Jack. Mark Geist.

156
00:11:27.021 --> 00:11:28.022
- Oz.
- Pleasure.

157
00:11:28.189 --> 00:11:31.192
Oh, brother, I'm sorry.
Everybody, this is Jack Silva.

158
00:11:31.776 --> 00:11:34.278
It's our third contract together,
so he knows the drill.

159
00:11:34.362 --> 00:11:35.946
We met training SEALs at Coronado.

160
00:11:36.113 --> 00:11:38.866
How do you get them to balance
that beach ball on their nose?

161
00:11:39.033 --> 00:11:40.034
It's tough.

162
00:11:40.117 --> 00:11:43.120
So we got 3 ex-Marines here
and one ex-Army retard

163
00:11:43.204 --> 00:11:44.644
who likes to rub his dick on things.

164
00:11:44.705 --> 00:11:46.374
Kris Paronto. Call me Tanto.

165
00:11:46.957 --> 00:11:48.292
Hey, man. I'm Tig.

166
00:11:48.876 --> 00:11:51.879
Tig's been here the longest,
so he'll get you up to speed on the area.

167
00:11:52.046 --> 00:11:53.756
This is Boon. Scout Sniper, Zen Master,

168
00:11:53.839 --> 00:11:55.049
holder of Tanto's leash.

169
00:11:55.132 --> 00:11:56.300
Welcome to Club Med.

170
00:11:56.884 --> 00:11:59.804
So it hasn't rained since June,
it's not gonna rain again until September.

171
00:11:59.887 --> 00:12:02.390
You're double-bunked.
Not me, because I'm in charge.

172
00:12:02.556 --> 00:12:04.642
The gym sucks, food's actually good.

173
00:12:04.809 --> 00:12:06.310
And the Base Chief is kind of a tool.

174
00:12:06.477 --> 00:12:07.478
Well, he's a dick today.

175
00:12:07.561 --> 00:12:08.979
Maybe he just needs a new hat.

176
00:12:09.563 --> 00:12:10.981
Don't encourage him.

177
00:12:11.148 --> 00:12:13.401
Oh, come on. He's a guy with a job to do.

178
00:12:13.567 --> 00:12:15.528
He's playing his string out,
but you talk to him,

179
00:12:15.653 --> 00:12:17.738
Bob did some shit back in the day.

180
00:12:17.905 --> 00:12:19.573
All right, Jack, this is the whiteboard

181
00:12:19.657 --> 00:12:21.909
that's gonna run your life
for the next 60 days.

182
00:12:22.076 --> 00:12:23.077
I want you to check it every hour,

183
00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.414
because last-minute moves
pop up every minute, such as

184
00:12:26.497 --> 00:12:28.257
we're shotgunning it in three hours.
Mmm-hmm.

185
00:12:29.917 --> 00:12:32.253
3 hours.
I'll let you know when I'm briefed.

186
00:12:44.432 --> 00:12:46.517
This was a private family compound

187
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.520
owned by a wealthy Libyan
who got out of town after the revolution

188
00:12:49.603 --> 00:12:51.355
and leased it to the CIA.

189
00:12:51.856 --> 00:12:53.274
He was smart.

190
00:12:54.692 --> 00:12:56.444
A little pungent.

191
00:12:56.902 --> 00:12:57.987
Mmm-hmm.

192
00:12:58.529 --> 00:13:00.698
A little spy tradecraft.

193
00:13:00.781 --> 00:13:04.535
Who'd expect Americans to be hiding out
next to a stank-ass slaughterhouse?

194
00:13:04.952 --> 00:13:06.620
We call it Zombieland.

195
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:15.463
Building A, B, C, D.

196
00:13:16.046 --> 00:13:18.048
- Hesham!
- Yes, sir.

197
00:13:19.049 --> 00:13:20.050
Yes, sir.

198
00:13:20.301 --> 00:13:22.386
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

199
00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:24.972
He's a good man.
But there's a few we got our eyes on,

200
00:13:25.055 --> 00:13:27.433
so always stay strapped.

201
00:13:33.731 --> 00:13:34.899
Damn kids!

202
00:13:48.662 --> 00:13:50.498
This is the bathroom.

203
00:13:51.248 --> 00:13:52.583
This is you.

204
00:13:52.917 --> 00:13:54.335
That's me.

205
00:13:54.668 --> 00:13:58.088
This curtain is meant to discourage you
from spooning with me. So...

206
00:14:07.806 --> 00:14:10.476
<i>Daddy, what do you do
when you go away for work?</i>

207
00:14:10.768 --> 00:14:12.603
Can't you work here?

208
00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:14.813
- We could have a treehouse business.
- Mmm-hmm.

209
00:14:15.147 --> 00:14:16.357
That sounds amazing.

210
00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.275
Then we could
always be together.

211
00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.363
You know, the girls don't need
a treehouse, Jack.

212
00:14:22.905 --> 00:14:24.281
<i>They need you.</i>

213
00:14:24.365 --> 00:14:26.700
<i>I just hope that one day,
you're not gonna wake up and realize</i>

214
00:14:26.784 --> 00:14:28.619
<i>you missed the best part of life.</i>

215
00:14:31.205 --> 00:14:32.414
<i>You contractors
are all married with kids,</i>

216
00:14:32.498 --> 00:14:35.376
yet none of you wear wedding rings.
Why is that?

217
00:14:35.876 --> 00:14:38.045
Our job is reading people.

218
00:14:38.128 --> 00:14:40.798
So, we can't give anyone an edge,
especially bad guys that might use it.

219
00:14:40.881 --> 00:14:44.677
I know you and Tyrone
go way back, so I'll be frank.

220
00:14:45.052 --> 00:14:47.555
The company thinks
you should be here. I don't.

221
00:14:48.472 --> 00:14:50.891
Truth is, there is no real threat here.

222
00:14:51.559 --> 00:14:53.894
We won the revolution for these people.

223
00:14:53.978 --> 00:14:55.138
The more guns there are here,

224
00:14:55.187 --> 00:14:57.523
the more likely there is
to be a misunderstanding.

225
00:14:58.399 --> 00:15:01.485
This is my last station before retiring.

226
00:15:02.278 --> 00:15:05.364
I don't need a misunderstanding.

227
00:15:06.532 --> 00:15:07.533
Is that clear?

228
00:15:08.158 --> 00:15:09.493
Loud and.

229
00:15:09.994 --> 00:15:12.162
These are your credentials,
2 weeks per Diem.

230
00:15:12.329 --> 00:15:15.332
I'd spend them quick.
Things change fast here in Benghazi.

231
00:15:16.542 --> 00:15:18.627
We have the brightest minds
from the Farm,

232
00:15:18.711 --> 00:15:21.046
educated at Harvard and Yale,
doing important work.

233
00:15:21.505 --> 00:15:24.425
Best thing for you to do
is stay out of their way.

234
00:15:25.009 --> 00:15:26.343
Fuck!

235
00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:27.595
Quiet!

236
00:15:27.678 --> 00:15:29.555
You act like animals!

237
00:15:33.267 --> 00:15:34.768
It's a CPU at Pepe's.

238
00:15:34.852 --> 00:15:37.187
It's all pretty simple stuff, guys.

239
00:15:37.438 --> 00:15:38.439
Public meet.

240
00:15:38.522 --> 00:15:40.107
Libyan oil company exec and his wife.

241
00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:41.567
Case Officers Vayner and Jillani.

242
00:15:41.692 --> 00:15:43.611
Jillani's been developing
this guy for months.

243
00:15:43.694 --> 00:15:45.487
"Developing" is their
new tech word for spy shit.

244
00:15:45.571 --> 00:15:47.364
Jack, since this is your
first time with us,

245
00:15:47.448 --> 00:15:48.949
you're gonna be posing
as Jillani's husband.

246
00:15:49.033 --> 00:15:50.034
Uh-oh.

247
00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:51.535
I rode bitch last week.

248
00:15:51.702 --> 00:15:52.870
She's a little spicy.

249
00:15:54.038 --> 00:15:56.373
Oz, Tig, limo. Boon, Tanto, follow.

250
00:15:56.457 --> 00:15:57.458
You?

251
00:15:57.583 --> 00:15:58.917
I drive.

252
00:16:00.711 --> 00:16:01.991
Hey, Jack, this is Sona,

253
00:16:02.046 --> 00:16:03.464
she's an American
who grew up in France,

254
00:16:03.547 --> 00:16:05.049
which makes her really friendly.

255
00:16:05.716 --> 00:16:06.759
Nice to meet you.

256
00:16:06.842 --> 00:16:09.219
Careful, Jack,
I think she's flirting with you.

257
00:16:11.805 --> 00:16:13.641
Okay.
Let's keep the make-nice to a minimum.

258
00:16:13.724 --> 00:16:14.892
I want to hook this guy tonight.

259
00:16:14.975 --> 00:16:15.976
He wants to work with us.

260
00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:17.269
Move too fast and you'll frighten him off.

261
00:16:17.353 --> 00:16:18.479
I know how to do this!

262
00:16:18.562 --> 00:16:19.688
He's new.

263
00:16:19.813 --> 00:16:20.981
Not to this.

264
00:16:22.983 --> 00:16:23.984
I don't understand.

265
00:16:24.068 --> 00:16:25.986
Why do they keep
changing security guards on us?

266
00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:27.780
They think we need babysitting.

267
00:16:28.072 --> 00:16:30.866
Okay. So just drink your coffee.
Don't try to help.

268
00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:32.284
Don't talk, either.

269
00:16:32.493 --> 00:16:34.912
My name is "Nazia,"
a lobbyist for Exxon Mobil.

270
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.123
Brit is "Peter," my boss.
And you're my husband, "Jack."

271
00:16:38.207 --> 00:16:39.208
Hang on.

272
00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:41.418
Jack's my real name.

273
00:16:41.543 --> 00:16:42.586
It is?

274
00:16:44.963 --> 00:16:46.298
Fantastic.

275
00:16:52.971 --> 00:16:54.723
It's nice to see you again, Fahreed.

276
00:16:54.807 --> 00:16:56.517
Let me introduce you to my boss, Peter.

277
00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.685
- Hi.
- Hello.

278
00:16:57.768 --> 00:16:58.769
And this is Jack, my husband.

279
00:16:58.936 --> 00:16:59.895
How are you? Very nice to meet you.

280
00:16:59.978 --> 00:17:01.105
This is my wife.

281
00:17:01.271 --> 00:17:02.439
Nice meeting you.

282
00:17:11.657 --> 00:17:14.243
Oh.
This is the best Italian restaurant. Come.

283
00:17:14.326 --> 00:17:15.327
Oh, fantastic.

284
00:17:15.953 --> 00:17:17.673
Please, after you.
Thank you.

285
00:17:20.708 --> 00:17:21.834
Hey.

286
00:17:22.668 --> 00:17:23.669
What's up?

287
00:17:23.794 --> 00:17:25.504
Hey, Oz. They're in. You got eyes?

288
00:17:25.838 --> 00:17:29.049
Yeah, just enjoying
a little Italian beanery here.

289
00:17:29.133 --> 00:17:31.635
You wouldn't know a good coffee bean
from a lump of squirrel shit, country boy.

290
00:17:31.719 --> 00:17:32.928
Just make sure you pick me up a bag of

291
00:17:33.011 --> 00:17:34.888
that whole bean Arabic Intense
on the way out.

292
00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.476
Fahreed, you can contact us
with this phone in the future.

293
00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:41.061
Good.

294
00:17:41.145 --> 00:17:42.438
And if you give me
a call in 3 days,

295
00:17:42.521 --> 00:17:45.232
I would love to see the manifest,
and we can go over the details.

296
00:17:45.315 --> 00:17:46.483
- Very good.
- Perfect.

297
00:18:01.749 --> 00:18:02.750
Hey.

298
00:18:02.833 --> 00:18:04.168
What's the Chief's number-one rule?

299
00:18:04.251 --> 00:18:05.377
Don't get out of the car?

300
00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:06.909
No, I'm getting out of the car.

301
00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:12.634
He's on the move.

302
00:18:14.386 --> 00:18:15.512
Cairo is great!

303
00:18:15.596 --> 00:18:16.889
Now, that is an underrated city.

304
00:18:16.972 --> 00:18:18.682
What I really love is the Nile Valley.

305
00:18:18.766 --> 00:18:20.225
The Nile Valley is beautiful.

306
00:18:20.726 --> 00:18:23.270
Yes, it's beautiful, but it's too busy.

307
00:18:25.355 --> 00:18:27.691
We had a bit of a fight this morning.

308
00:18:28.358 --> 00:18:29.693
No, we didn't.

309
00:18:43.707 --> 00:18:46.376
Good price. Two. Two, sir. Good price.

310
00:18:48.962 --> 00:18:50.297
The rocket.

311
00:18:51.548 --> 00:18:52.716
Russian rocket.

312
00:18:58.889 --> 00:19:00.891
Come on, Oz, pick up the phone.

313
00:19:09.983 --> 00:19:12.319
We are weighing
a serious move on the Syrian market.

314
00:19:13.278 --> 00:19:14.780
We got to go.

315
00:19:14.947 --> 00:19:17.032
So, that's why
we really need your shipping support.

316
00:19:17.115 --> 00:19:19.117
Sorry to rush off. Babysitter.

317
00:19:19.493 --> 00:19:21.036
I'm so sorry, but we will be in touch.

318
00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:22.412
Sorry again.

319
00:19:22.579 --> 00:19:24.331
Let's go. Go, go, go.

320
00:19:38.929 --> 00:19:40.347
Go, go, go.

321
00:19:41.098 --> 00:19:42.850
Go, go, go. Get in.

322
00:19:43.016 --> 00:19:44.351
Don't you ever handle me like that again!

323
00:19:44.434 --> 00:19:45.644
Who the fuck do you think you are?

324
00:19:45.811 --> 00:19:47.271
You never get out of the car, ever!

325
00:19:47.354 --> 00:19:48.939
You just fucking blew that meet.

326
00:19:49.356 --> 00:19:50.858
Picked up a tail.

327
00:19:51.275 --> 00:19:53.443
See the green van? That's your tail.

328
00:19:54.945 --> 00:19:56.029
Shake and bake!

329
00:19:56.113 --> 00:19:57.473
Green van behind you. We're on it.

330
00:19:57.614 --> 00:19:59.241
Make a left, then another left.

331
00:19:59.324 --> 00:20:00.325
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

332
00:20:07.749 --> 00:20:10.460
This is my second war tour!
I know what I'm fucking doing.

333
00:20:12.379 --> 00:20:13.797
Well, this is my 12th.

334
00:20:13.964 --> 00:20:16.300
If they got pictures of us,
then we need to get them.

335
00:20:16.466 --> 00:20:17.801
I would love to, but that's not our job.

336
00:20:17.885 --> 00:20:19.553
"Protect, not engage."
The Chief's orders.

337
00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.054
Got 'em right behind.

338
00:20:22.598 --> 00:20:23.765
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

339
00:20:30.814 --> 00:20:32.232
Get out of the fucking road!

340
00:20:40.949 --> 00:20:42.784
- Oh, careful.
- Rone, coming up on your left!

341
00:20:42.951 --> 00:20:44.286
Excuse me.

342
00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:45.871
Pardon me. Switch sides.

343
00:20:48.415 --> 00:20:50.000
<i>He's on you tight, man.
He's getting aggressive.</i>

344
00:20:50.167 --> 00:20:51.418
Yeah. I see him. I see him.

345
00:20:51.501 --> 00:20:52.836
Jack, if he gets too close, drop him.

346
00:20:53.003 --> 00:20:54.046
Watch out!

347
00:21:00.344 --> 00:21:03.105
I might not have gone to Harvard,
but I'm pretty sure that was a tail.

348
00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:16.401
Hey, guys.

349
00:21:16.652 --> 00:21:17.861
<i>- Hi, Daddy!
- Hi, Daddy!</i>

350
00:21:17.945 --> 00:21:19.404
Hey! Good to see you.

351
00:21:19.821 --> 00:21:22.324
Guys, guys, take a look.
Meet my new friend.

352
00:21:22.741 --> 00:21:24.493
- Isn't he cool?
- <i>Ew. It's gross!</i>

353
00:21:24.701 --> 00:21:26.828
He is a grand master at catching flies.

354
00:21:27.245 --> 00:21:29.456
All day, he just sits here
and grabs one at a time.

355
00:21:29.539 --> 00:21:31.291
<i>Are you gonna
shave your beard, Daddy?</i>

356
00:21:31.375 --> 00:21:33.585
Well, depends on what Mommy thinks.
Beck, what do you think?

357
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:34.711
<i>Very handsome.</i>

358
00:21:34.795 --> 00:21:35.837
How's kindergarten, Em?

359
00:21:35.921 --> 00:21:37.547
<i>Today is my turn
to feed Winston.</i>

360
00:21:37.714 --> 00:21:39.883
Very cool, very cool.

361
00:21:39.967 --> 00:21:41.218
Who is Winston?

362
00:21:41.301 --> 00:21:43.512
- <i>He's the class goldfish!</i>
- Oh.

363
00:21:43.679 --> 00:21:46.181
<i>Mommy says I can
bring him home one weekend.</i>

364
00:21:46.348 --> 00:21:48.183
<i>Be nice to have
a man around the house, huh?</i>

365
00:21:49.017 --> 00:21:50.852
- Okay.
- <i>Can we go play now?</i>

366
00:21:51.019 --> 00:21:53.021
<i>GRS meet in the team room.</i>

367
00:21:53.188 --> 00:21:54.398
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

368
00:21:54.564 --> 00:21:55.774
Babe, I think I got to go.

369
00:21:55.857 --> 00:21:56.984
<i>Was that Ty?</i>

370
00:21:57.067 --> 00:21:58.819
It's just a muster call.
It's probably nothing.

371
00:21:58.902 --> 00:22:00.570
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Sorry.

372
00:22:00.737 --> 00:22:03.323
Just tell the girls I say
I love them, all right?

373
00:22:03.407 --> 00:22:04.908
I'll call you tomorrow.

374
00:22:05.075 --> 00:22:07.244
I love you. Bye.

375
00:22:09.871 --> 00:22:13.792
<i>Silva! You're fucking late! As usual.</i>

376
00:22:14.167 --> 00:22:16.837
<i>Glen Doherty.</i>
<i>What's up, brother?</i>

377
00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:19.548
Rone said you were in Tripoli.
What's the occasion?

378
00:22:19.631 --> 00:22:21.675
Ambassador Chris Stevens
is coming in from Tripoli

379
00:22:21.758 --> 00:22:23.010
Monday morning.

380
00:22:23.093 --> 00:22:24.428
Well, you'll be home.

381
00:22:24.594 --> 00:22:27.222
Not anymore. Three of us extended.

382
00:22:27.305 --> 00:22:29.545
<i>The Ambassador is staying at
the Special Mission Compound</i>

383
00:22:29.599 --> 00:22:30.934
<i>at his own insistence.</i>

384
00:22:31.768 --> 00:22:33.854
<i>I know. I know it's a problem.</i>

385
00:22:34.104 --> 00:22:35.439
<i>And here's the thing.</i>

386
00:22:35.605 --> 00:22:38.525
<i>The Ambassador isn't
some dilettante political appointee.</i>

387
00:22:38.608 --> 00:22:40.235
<i>He's the real deal.</i>

388
00:22:40.444 --> 00:22:41.611
<i>A true believer.</i>

389
00:22:41.778 --> 00:22:43.530
He's there to win hearts and minds.

390
00:22:43.613 --> 00:22:46.116
Now, he can't very well do that
operating out of a classified facility

391
00:22:46.199 --> 00:22:47.617
that doesn't officially exist.

392
00:22:47.701 --> 00:22:49.786
If he's racking
at the consulate with his State detail,

393
00:22:49.911 --> 00:22:51.747
then what fuck
does this have to do with us?

394
00:22:51.955 --> 00:22:54.708
<i>He's traveling with no staff,
just a 2-man security team.</i>

395
00:22:55.292 --> 00:22:58.712
<i>Now, the State guys
don't know the city like you guys do.</i>

396
00:22:58.962 --> 00:23:00.881
<i>The Ambassador insisted
on local drivers,</i>

397
00:23:00.964 --> 00:23:02.382
<i>but we won that argument.</i>

398
00:23:02.466 --> 00:23:04.092
- So we're chauffeurs now.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

399
00:23:04.301 --> 00:23:06.053
<i>Highly trained, highly paid chauffeurs.</i>

400
00:23:06.136 --> 00:23:08.722
Chief won't go for it.
He doesn't want us doing anything.

401
00:23:08.805 --> 00:23:11.850
<i>He didn't go for it. But he got outranked.</i>

402
00:23:12.601 --> 00:23:14.269
<i>Now, the Ambassador deserves the best,</i>

403
00:23:14.352 --> 00:23:15.854
<i>and that's GRS, right?</i>

404
00:23:19.816 --> 00:23:21.276
Hey. Right here. These dudes.

405
00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:24.404
Bad guy house your tail van got towed to.

406
00:23:25.822 --> 00:23:27.949
Yeah, smile, motherfuckers.

407
00:23:28.658 --> 00:23:31.161
It's just two blocks from the compound.

408
00:23:40.337 --> 00:23:41.630
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

409
00:23:41.713 --> 00:23:44.549
All right. Hey, what's the problem?

410
00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:47.761
First of all, tell them to calm down.

411
00:23:47.844 --> 00:23:49.805
Everybody, dial it the fuck down!

412
00:23:49.888 --> 00:23:50.931
All right, what is the problem?

413
00:23:51.014 --> 00:23:53.850
17 Feb. These guys look like fun.

414
00:23:54.017 --> 00:23:57.104
There will be no striking. All right?
Get back to work.

415
00:23:57.771 --> 00:23:59.940
How would you feel if you had to
protect Americans at $28 a day

416
00:24:00.023 --> 00:24:01.566
and then bring your own bullets?

417
00:24:02.192 --> 00:24:04.653
Well, why leave security
to the professionals, right?

418
00:24:21.044 --> 00:24:22.379
Gentlemen!

419
00:24:22.629 --> 00:24:24.297
Welcome to the <i>casa.</i>

420
00:24:24.381 --> 00:24:27.300
You guys picked the wrong month
for a bad mustache competition.

421
00:24:27.384 --> 00:24:28.844
Hundred bucks on the line.

422
00:24:28.969 --> 00:24:30.470
Got this one in the bag.

423
00:24:30.887 --> 00:24:32.722
- Scott Wickland.
- Tyrone Woods.

424
00:24:32.889 --> 00:24:33.974
Dave Ubben.

425
00:24:34.057 --> 00:24:36.393
Come on.
Let me give you the grand tour.

426
00:24:37.727 --> 00:24:39.146
Huh?

427
00:24:39.229 --> 00:24:40.480
I can relate.
Wow.

428
00:24:41.064 --> 00:24:42.899
It's like the lobby at Caesars.

429
00:24:43.066 --> 00:24:45.152
- Damn!
- Shit's bangin'.

430
00:24:45.235 --> 00:24:48.155
Makes you forget
you're in Benghazi.

431
00:24:48.238 --> 00:24:50.574
Hey, guys. I'm Agent Alec.

432
00:24:50.824 --> 00:24:53.160
Just dealing with some
Middle Eastern Keystone Cops

433
00:24:53.243 --> 00:24:54.244
out at the gate.

434
00:24:54.327 --> 00:24:56.746
Those guys yell a lot.

435
00:24:56.872 --> 00:24:58.999
What's your setup here?

436
00:24:59.082 --> 00:25:02.252
Our Ambo's residence in this half
of the villa is the safe haven.

437
00:25:02.335 --> 00:25:04.337
Forced-entry, blast-resistant door.

438
00:25:04.588 --> 00:25:06.423
Security bars on the windows.

439
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:08.425
Inside that is our safe room.

440
00:25:08.592 --> 00:25:10.427
Ambo have any tactical experience?

441
00:25:11.511 --> 00:25:14.014
Nah. He has us.

442
00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:21.021
So, it's a 9-acre
compound, shotgun style

443
00:25:21.438 --> 00:25:22.606
from here,

444
00:25:23.523 --> 00:25:25.358
all the way to the back.

445
00:25:26.443 --> 00:25:27.777
I'll take you there.

446
00:25:27.944 --> 00:25:29.696
His room links
to State in D.C. and Tripoli.

447
00:25:29.779 --> 00:25:31.448
That's the TOC?
Yeah.

448
00:25:31.948 --> 00:25:33.283
Back gate?

449
00:25:33.617 --> 00:25:36.286
One way only. Emergency exit.

450
00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:39.289
Got a couple 17 Febs
on detail, cameras.

451
00:25:39.414 --> 00:25:40.540
It's locked.

452
00:25:40.999 --> 00:25:43.835
What kind of firepower
you guys carry other than assault rifles?

453
00:25:43.919 --> 00:25:45.420
We've got multiple small arms.

454
00:25:45.587 --> 00:25:47.964
And ammo in the TacOps Center
just beyond the cantina.

455
00:25:48.089 --> 00:25:49.089
That way.

456
00:25:49.132 --> 00:25:50.133
That's it?

457
00:25:50.467 --> 00:25:53.720
I thought every embassy had standard
hard-target security measures.

458
00:25:53.929 --> 00:25:55.972
Car bomb barricades, full-time Marines.

459
00:25:56.139 --> 00:25:57.474
Supposed to.

460
00:25:57.641 --> 00:25:59.309
This isn't an embassy.

461
00:25:59.976 --> 00:26:02.145
We're a temporary diplomatic outpost.

462
00:26:02.646 --> 00:26:04.314
Uncle Sam's on a budget right now,

463
00:26:04.397 --> 00:26:07.484
so I guess normal
security regulations don't apply.

464
00:26:08.235 --> 00:26:10.904
Man, that's some real
"dot-gov" shit, huh?

465
00:26:11.154 --> 00:26:13.156
It's like our own little resort.

466
00:26:14.074 --> 00:26:18.161
I hate to piss on your party, ladies,
but 5 dudes with M4s is not enough.

467
00:26:18.745 --> 00:26:21.081
The locals on your front gate
are worthless,

468
00:26:21.164 --> 00:26:22.164
perimeter's soft,

469
00:26:22.207 --> 00:26:24.501
and this whole compound's
a fucking sniper's paradise.

470
00:26:24.918 --> 00:26:27.921
Any big element gets inside here,
you guys are gonna fucking die.

471
00:26:29.005 --> 00:26:30.298
Well, that's heartwarming.

472
00:26:30.924 --> 00:26:31.925
What?

473
00:26:32.759 --> 00:26:33.843
No offense.

474
00:26:33.969 --> 00:26:35.428
Guys, we're a mile down the road.

475
00:26:35.512 --> 00:26:39.266
Anything goes down, you call us,
I send Boon, you're good.

476
00:26:40.016 --> 00:26:41.518
Take care, guys.

477
00:26:41.851 --> 00:26:42.852
What do you think?

478
00:26:42.978 --> 00:26:45.855
A dozen years of military
experience between them, max?

479
00:26:46.022 --> 00:26:47.524
Gonna be a fun week.

480
00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.633
Djibouti, request retasking ScanEagle.

481
00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.052
<i>Copy that.
I have eyes on both.</i>

482
00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.222
<i>Oz, sniper over-watch.
Get in position.</i>

483
00:27:21.975 --> 00:27:23.695
Amahl, you lived here all your life, right?

484
00:27:23.893 --> 00:27:24.894
Yes.

485
00:27:26.146 --> 00:27:27.897
Is it true Gaddafi only hired females

486
00:27:28.064 --> 00:27:29.816
for his personal security detail?

487
00:27:30.317 --> 00:27:33.653
Yes. That is accurate.

488
00:27:39.492 --> 00:27:42.495
Gaddafi might've been an evil asshole,
but he wasn't stupid.

489
00:27:58.428 --> 00:27:59.888
I hate this part.

490
00:28:00.597 --> 00:28:02.057
Here we go, guys.

491
00:28:02.932 --> 00:28:04.434
<i>Oz, let's rock.</i>

492
00:28:26.289 --> 00:28:28.291
<i>I got the skinny on the right.</i>

493
00:28:29.417 --> 00:28:31.586
Let me take the whack-out guy.

494
00:28:37.717 --> 00:28:39.302
Amahl, tell this guy to calm down.

495
00:28:41.471 --> 00:28:42.555
Easy, easy.

496
00:28:42.722 --> 00:28:44.362
He's saying bring
your weapon down.

497
00:28:45.308 --> 00:28:47.060
He wants his money.

498
00:28:47.143 --> 00:28:48.395
Okay, okay.

499
00:28:48.728 --> 00:28:50.730
This is your money.

500
00:28:51.898 --> 00:28:53.900
Amahl, tell this guy
to calm the fuck down.

501
00:28:54.234 --> 00:28:55.402
That guy's whacked.

502
00:28:55.568 --> 00:28:56.653
Your money.

503
00:28:58.655 --> 00:28:59.739
Hey, big man!

504
00:29:00.907 --> 00:29:02.409
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey! Jambo.

505
00:29:02.784 --> 00:29:04.119
You know the jambo, yeah?

506
00:29:05.829 --> 00:29:06.996
Come on.

507
00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:08.998
<i>Okay, cool down. Okay?</i>

508
00:29:16.923 --> 00:29:18.508
Cool, baby.

509
00:29:18.633 --> 00:29:19.634
Come on.

510
00:29:19.759 --> 00:29:21.177
<i>That guy almost lost his head.</i>

511
00:29:21.344 --> 00:29:22.762
<i>Base, we are good.</i>

512
00:29:22.846 --> 00:29:24.806
<i>Mercenaries all
know the jambo, Amahl.</i>

513
00:29:24.889 --> 00:29:26.057
<i>These guys are all right.</i>

514
00:29:31.813 --> 00:29:34.315
<i>Base, we're looking
at a lot of Russian SA-7s.</i>

515
00:29:34.399 --> 00:29:36.693
Tell him to maintain eyes on the truck
as long as he can.

516
00:29:37.527 --> 00:29:41.823
We're gonna find his stash
and we're gonna level it with a Hellfire.

517
00:29:42.198 --> 00:29:43.825
Hi. Hi, Chris Stevens.

518
00:29:43.992 --> 00:29:45.535
- Sona.
- Sona, nice to meet you. Bob.

519
00:29:45.702 --> 00:29:47.537
- Thank you for doing that.
- It's my pleasure.

520
00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:48.872
- It means a lot.
- So good to be back.

521
00:29:48.955 --> 00:29:51.291
This is our CDOB, Alan.
Brit Vayner.

522
00:29:51.374 --> 00:29:52.625
Alan, Chris Stevens. Brit, pleasure.

523
00:29:52.709 --> 00:29:55.295
Gentlemen, greetings. Chris Stevens.

524
00:29:55.462 --> 00:29:56.629
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Ambassador.

525
00:29:56.713 --> 00:29:58.131
Nice to meet you. Step on in.

526
00:29:59.048 --> 00:30:01.676
So between what
we see happening in Egypt with Morsi

527
00:30:01.759 --> 00:30:03.636
and the current destabilization of Syria,

528
00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.638
yes, it's easy to imagine

529
00:30:05.722 --> 00:30:07.599
any number of scenarios
playing out here.

530
00:30:07.932 --> 00:30:09.601
However, in my mind,

531
00:30:09.767 --> 00:30:12.562
our biggest mistake would
be to not view this moment

532
00:30:12.645 --> 00:30:13.897
as an opportunity.

533
00:30:14.063 --> 00:30:16.941
Relationships between
governments are important, yes,

534
00:30:17.025 --> 00:30:18.985
but relationships between people

535
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:21.070
are the real foundation of diplomacy.

536
00:30:21.237 --> 00:30:24.616
And I believe
that it is our mission as Americans

537
00:30:24.782 --> 00:30:27.076
to help Benghazans form a free,

538
00:30:27.202 --> 00:30:29.412
democratic and prosperous Libya.

539
00:30:36.336 --> 00:30:37.337
Okay. Thanks.

540
00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:38.755
In my office, now.

541
00:30:39.964 --> 00:30:41.174
Don't bother apologizing.
I'll do it.

542
00:30:41.257 --> 00:30:42.300
Well, I won't.

543
00:30:42.383 --> 00:30:44.677
'Cause I've heard the rah-rah
speech about politics and progress

544
00:30:44.761 --> 00:30:46.221
a hundred goddamn times before.

545
00:30:46.387 --> 00:30:47.555
Well, then I'll write you up.

546
00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:48.806
Sweet.

547
00:30:48.973 --> 00:30:51.476
Chief. Chief,
the guy's going on 2 hours sleep.

548
00:30:51.643 --> 00:30:54.203
He had a late scout last night
and an early buyback this morning.

549
00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:56.105
Yeah, buying up all of Gaddafi's arms.

550
00:30:56.272 --> 00:30:59.033
Let's count the fucking sand particles
on the beach while we're at it.

551
00:31:00.068 --> 00:31:01.736
Those 30 Grails
that you took off the black market,

552
00:31:01.819 --> 00:31:04.072
that's 30 airplanes that don't go down.

553
00:31:04.322 --> 00:31:06.658
I'm so sick of your shit, Tanto.

554
00:31:06.824 --> 00:31:09.035
If you can't figure out
how to act like a professional,

555
00:31:09.118 --> 00:31:11.329
there are 10 guys
waiting to take your spot.

556
00:31:11.496 --> 00:31:14.541
And I'm sure that you'll be happy at home
being an insurance adjuster.

557
00:31:19.087 --> 00:31:20.338
That's the last chance, Tyrone.

558
00:31:28.346 --> 00:31:29.430
<i>All right. GRS,</i>

559
00:31:29.514 --> 00:31:31.432
<i>the Ambassador has
a private meet at the Mayor's office.</i>

560
00:31:31.516 --> 00:31:33.351
<i>So, we're looking at a low-profile event.</i>

561
00:31:33.518 --> 00:31:36.729
<i>We're here to back up State,
so just stay in the background.</i>

562
00:31:50.034 --> 00:31:52.870
<i>Ambo's entering.
Dave, take right side.</i>

563
00:32:01.588 --> 00:32:03.708
Oh. What is this?
You've got to be kidding me.

564
00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.174
So much for a low profile.

565
00:32:05.508 --> 00:32:07.677
<i>Fuck me. Who let them in?</i>

566
00:32:08.511 --> 00:32:11.097
America is here for you.

567
00:32:12.015 --> 00:32:13.016
We are.

568
00:32:13.391 --> 00:32:17.186
This? This is the shit
that pisses my wife off.

569
00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:19.522
Any one of these people
could klack off a vest.

570
00:32:19.689 --> 00:32:21.009
At least it'll be quick, brother.

571
00:32:21.983 --> 00:32:23.359
Don't be an asshole.

572
00:32:23.693 --> 00:32:26.529
A number of countries
have come forth and offered loans,

573
00:32:26.613 --> 00:32:27.864
most recently Turkey.

574
00:32:49.844 --> 00:32:51.262
<i>Thank you, gentlemen.</i>

575
00:32:52.388 --> 00:32:54.891
Sir. Are we clear on tomorrow?

576
00:32:56.809 --> 00:33:00.438
I have been persuaded
in an abundance of caution

577
00:33:01.022 --> 00:33:03.274
to remain inside
the compound walls all day,

578
00:33:03.358 --> 00:33:06.986
given the 9/11 anniversary,
so no drivers needed.

579
00:33:07.528 --> 00:33:08.863
Good night.

580
00:33:09.155 --> 00:33:10.156
Hey.

581
00:33:10.406 --> 00:33:13.201
These militias,
they have unlimited firepower

582
00:33:13.284 --> 00:33:14.369
and they can coordinate.

583
00:33:14.452 --> 00:33:15.953
You've got to keep his moves low.

584
00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:18.247
Yeah, it was supposed
to be closed door.

585
00:33:18.331 --> 00:33:20.792
Someone from the city council
tipped the media.

586
00:33:22.543 --> 00:33:24.712
Sean Smith,

587
00:33:25.421 --> 00:33:27.590
meet Rone, Jack and Tig
from the annex.

588
00:33:27.674 --> 00:33:28.841
- Hi.
- How you doing?

589
00:33:28.925 --> 00:33:31.511
Sean was sent here
to install secure comms for the Ambo.

590
00:33:31.594 --> 00:33:33.554
Ended up supercharging our Wi-Fi.

591
00:33:33.638 --> 00:33:35.264
Wish he could do that at our residence.

592
00:33:35.348 --> 00:33:36.516
I got security clearance.

593
00:33:36.599 --> 00:33:38.768
Maybe later this week I'll come by.

594
00:33:39.519 --> 00:33:41.270
Gentlemen,
we should be good here.

595
00:33:41.354 --> 00:33:43.856
Call you later to check in.
Have a nice day off.

596
00:33:45.024 --> 00:33:47.026
- How'd it go?
- He's a rock star.

597
00:33:47.193 --> 00:33:49.195
Everybody in Benghazi
knew he'd be there.

598
00:33:49.362 --> 00:33:50.655
Oh, wait, no, no.
This is it. This is it.

599
00:33:50.738 --> 00:33:52.031
This is Downey's line. Hold on.

600
00:33:52.115 --> 00:33:54.200
<i>Me? I know who I am!</i>

601
00:33:54.367 --> 00:33:58.204
I'm just a dude playing
a dude disguised as another dude.

602
00:33:58.287 --> 00:33:59.288
Classic.

603
00:34:02.709 --> 00:34:04.544
From the U.S. Department of State.

604
00:34:04.627 --> 00:34:06.421
"Be advised.
Reports that a Western facility"

605
00:34:06.504 --> 00:34:09.257
"or U.S. installation may be
attacked in the next week."

606
00:34:13.511 --> 00:34:14.846
Read and destroy.

607
00:35:08.858 --> 00:35:11.277
<i>It is so nice to
be back in Benghazi.</i>

608
00:35:11.611 --> 00:35:13.362
<i>Much stronger emotional connection...</i>

609
00:35:13.613 --> 00:35:15.531
<i>Green, spacious, beautiful compound.</i>

610
00:35:15.698 --> 00:35:17.950
<i>Reconnected with February 17th...</i>

611
00:35:18.201 --> 00:35:19.702
<i>Security is a big concern.</i>

612
00:35:19.869 --> 00:35:21.709
<i>Saw people taking photos
of the compound today.</i>

613
00:35:21.788 --> 00:35:23.539
<i>Feel unsafe here.
My guys are concerned.</i>

614
00:35:23.623 --> 00:35:24.791
<i>...guns at arms bazaars...</i>

615
00:35:24.874 --> 00:35:26.542
<i>Voiced it to Tripoli.</i>

616
00:35:26.709 --> 00:35:28.127
<i>It's crazy.</i>

617
00:35:41.224 --> 00:35:42.391
Hey, Nick?

618
00:35:46.229 --> 00:35:48.231
It's the second time I've noticed it.

619
00:35:51.526 --> 00:35:56.405
<i>Hey, Nick, Dave? See if Feb 17
saw anybody at the back gate.</i>

620
00:35:56.489 --> 00:36:00.243
<i>Well, get somebody who speaks Arabic
so we can ask them a question.</i>

621
00:36:45.955 --> 00:36:47.874
Yeah, come on, put her on the phone.

622
00:36:48.457 --> 00:36:50.251
Oh! Hey, baby.

623
00:36:50.334 --> 00:36:52.879
<i>Kid's discovered she likes Doritos.</i>

624
00:36:56.215 --> 00:36:57.216
Yeah!

625
00:36:57.425 --> 00:36:58.551
Yeah, that's okay.

626
00:36:58.634 --> 00:36:59.954
You can eat it. You can taste it.

627
00:37:00.052 --> 00:37:01.762
Yeah, buddy, look at your eyes.

628
00:37:02.054 --> 00:37:03.890
Look at that. Who does he look like?

629
00:37:03.973 --> 00:37:05.016
What?

630
00:37:07.226 --> 00:37:08.728
Daughter's drinking.

631
00:37:08.895 --> 00:37:10.021
You drank when you were 15.

632
00:37:10.146 --> 00:37:11.314
Little girls don't drink.

633
00:37:11.522 --> 00:37:14.191
Disneyland? How lucky are you guys?

634
00:37:14.483 --> 00:37:16.402
- What are you guys gonna ride?
- <i>Jumbo.</i>

635
00:37:16.569 --> 00:37:18.738
<i>Dumbo, not Jumbo. Dumbo.</i>

636
00:37:19.071 --> 00:37:21.490
Em, did you thank Mommy?
Say thank you?

637
00:37:21.657 --> 00:37:22.658
- Yes, we did.
- Yes.

638
00:37:22.742 --> 00:37:24.076
<i>I don't think you did.</i>

639
00:37:24.827 --> 00:37:28.205
Huh? Yeah, I'll show them. Hold on.
Baby, that's not me.

640
00:37:28.414 --> 00:37:30.333
That's mean. Look at this.

641
00:37:30.499 --> 00:37:34.253
<i>...mate for
1.2 seconds and the act is complete.</i>

642
00:37:37.381 --> 00:37:38.925
Why would you send that?

643
00:37:39.091 --> 00:37:41.719
Anyway, if it was, it'd be
the best 3 seconds of your life.

644
00:37:41.886 --> 00:37:44.722
<i>We miss you. Be safe. We love you.</i>

645
00:37:44.889 --> 00:37:45.932
Yeah, I love you, too.

646
00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:47.475
What's he doing?

647
00:37:47.725 --> 00:37:50.311
I want to eat those fleshy arms!
Come on!

648
00:37:50.561 --> 00:37:51.687
<i>What about the life insurance?</i>

649
00:37:51.771 --> 00:37:52.897
<i>This is the second notice.</i>

650
00:37:53.147 --> 00:37:54.273
You gotta... You got to pay it.

651
00:37:54.357 --> 00:37:56.192
Okay, okay, I'll figure it out.

652
00:37:56.359 --> 00:37:58.569
<i>And what are we doing
about the oak tree in the front lawn?</i>

653
00:37:58.653 --> 00:38:02.531
The removal's $700...
No, it's $1,200, not $700.

654
00:38:02.615 --> 00:38:03.991
The guy's trying to rip me off.

655
00:38:04.575 --> 00:38:08.037
Becky, Becky, listen.
I'll be home in 2 weeks. Okay?

656
00:38:08.329 --> 00:38:10.122
So I'll take it down myself.

657
00:38:10.206 --> 00:38:11.926
Then we're really gonna
need life insurance.

658
00:38:15.169 --> 00:38:16.504
I know, I'm...

659
00:38:16.837 --> 00:38:18.839
I'm trying. I'm coming home soon.

660
00:38:19.006 --> 00:38:20.716
<i>Welcome to McDonald's.</i>
McDonald's!

661
00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:23.344
Guys, chill out! Turn it down!

662
00:38:23.427 --> 00:38:25.471
Calm down. Mommy's driving. Okay?

663
00:38:25.554 --> 00:38:27.473
We'll take 25 Happy Meals, please!

664
00:38:27.723 --> 00:38:29.809
<i>No, we don't want
25 Happy Meals.</i>

665
00:38:30.059 --> 00:38:31.699
Sir, can you just hang on
one more second?

666
00:38:31.727 --> 00:38:32.979
We're so hungry!

667
00:38:33.062 --> 00:38:34.855
I know you are. Just hold on.

668
00:38:35.022 --> 00:38:36.440
But we want the toys.

669
00:38:36.524 --> 00:38:38.317
Just give me whatever you want.
Six of whatever.

670
00:38:38.401 --> 00:38:39.652
I've got 6 hungry kids.

671
00:38:39.735 --> 00:38:41.570
- <i>We don't do that here.</i>
- Throw it all in there.

672
00:38:41.737 --> 00:38:44.407
Daddy, we're having a baby!

673
00:38:45.074 --> 00:38:47.076
- <i>What?</i>
- Oh, Emily!

674
00:38:49.078 --> 00:38:50.579
Becky, what did she just say?

675
00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:54.583
A baby. We're having a baby.

676
00:38:55.459 --> 00:38:57.503
- Another baby?
<i>- A baby.</i>

677
00:38:57.795 --> 00:38:59.463
<i>How many Happy Meals
did you want?</i>

678
00:38:59.547 --> 00:39:02.299
You can give me
whatever you want! I don't care.

679
00:39:02.466 --> 00:39:04.026
<i>Chicken McNuggets
or cheeseburgers?</i>

680
00:39:04.093 --> 00:39:05.333
We're having a sister!

681
00:39:05.428 --> 00:39:07.596
No, that's it, please.

682
00:39:08.055 --> 00:39:10.266
<i>About 1,500 people gathered</i>

683
00:39:10.391 --> 00:39:12.768
<i>outside the American Embassy
here in Cairo...</i>

684
00:39:12.935 --> 00:39:14.770
So, anything new back home?

685
00:39:15.104 --> 00:39:16.772
<i>...to voice their discontent and anger</i>

686
00:39:16.897 --> 00:39:19.942
<i>about an American-made amateur film</i>

687
00:39:20.067 --> 00:39:21.902
<i>they say is insulting
to the Prophet Muhammad.</i>

688
00:39:21.986 --> 00:39:22.987
No?

689
00:39:23.571 --> 00:39:24.905
Nothing?

690
00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:27.575
Good talk.

691
00:39:29.285 --> 00:39:30.786
<i>They say that although it's amateur,</i>

692
00:39:30.911 --> 00:39:32.496
<i>it is very much insulting</i>

693
00:39:32.621 --> 00:39:35.833
<i>toward the prophet Muhammad
and that is their red line.</i>

694
00:39:50.973 --> 00:39:52.349
Ooh, ooh!

695
00:39:53.934 --> 00:39:55.019
What up?

696
00:39:55.144 --> 00:39:56.687
- Heard about Cairo?
- Mmm-hmm.

697
00:39:56.771 --> 00:39:57.772
Ah!

698
00:40:02.318 --> 00:40:03.819
Enlighten me, Boon.

699
00:40:04.445 --> 00:40:06.572
"All the gods, all the heavens,"

700
00:40:06.655 --> 00:40:08.866
"all the hells are within you."

701
00:40:09.116 --> 00:40:10.951
- Within me?
- Within you.

702
00:40:12.828 --> 00:40:14.747
- I might have to think about that one.
- Ooh, ooh!

703
00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:16.499
- Be here all night.
- All right.

704
00:40:16.665 --> 00:40:17.958
Ooh, ooh!

705
00:40:18.042 --> 00:40:21.253
You know, I do have
a gun in my cubby and I will use it.

706
00:40:25.007 --> 00:40:26.050
Good luck.

707
00:40:26.383 --> 00:40:29.178
She's having dinner with her contact.
We'll be back at 2200.

708
00:40:48.906 --> 00:40:50.324
Yeah.

709
00:40:50.533 --> 00:40:53.202
Well, I'm still waiting to hear back
from State on that.

710
00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:35.161
Hey, listen, I just wanted to say
I'm sorry about today.

711
00:41:35.244 --> 00:41:36.954
I don't know what I was thinking.

712
00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:39.498
I guess with what we got going on,

713
00:41:39.582 --> 00:41:41.834
I just wanted everything
to be right, you know. I...

714
00:41:42.001 --> 00:41:45.004
I just wanted to do it right, but

715
00:41:46.839 --> 00:41:48.757
I'm so happy. I...

716
00:41:49.508 --> 00:41:51.177
I can't believe it.

717
00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:52.761
Um...

718
00:41:54.263 --> 00:41:56.515
I miss you guys very much.

719
00:41:57.183 --> 00:41:59.185
I wish I was home.

720
00:42:00.936 --> 00:42:02.855
I just wish I was home.

721
00:42:19.622 --> 00:42:20.956
It'll knock your teeth out.

722
00:42:21.707 --> 00:42:23.542
This is some good guava shisha.

723
00:42:24.752 --> 00:42:25.753
Yeah, I got you.

724
00:42:38.724 --> 00:42:40.226
Is that the front gate?

725
00:42:46.732 --> 00:42:47.942
Holy fuck!

726
00:42:48.067 --> 00:42:49.235
Go jock up!

727
00:43:18.847 --> 00:43:20.927
I'm getting the Ambo!
I'll take the TOC!

728
00:43:21.016 --> 00:43:22.376
Follow me, Vinnie! Watch your 6.

729
00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:27.856
What's going on?

730
00:43:48.627 --> 00:43:52.798
Chris! Get your body armor on!
Get into the safe haven! Go!

731
00:43:53.048 --> 00:43:54.049
Go!

732
00:43:54.341 --> 00:43:55.509
Hurry!

733
00:44:05.894 --> 00:44:07.896
Oh, my God. They're everywhere.

734
00:44:09.148 --> 00:44:10.816
What should we do?

735
00:44:28.208 --> 00:44:29.877
Where's the M4?

736
00:44:31.587 --> 00:44:32.588
Sean!

737
00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:36.383
Dave, get your weapon
and move fast to villa.

738
00:44:36.467 --> 00:44:37.468
<i>How many?</i>

739
00:44:40.512 --> 00:44:42.264
<i>All DS be advised,
there are 30...</i>

740
00:44:43.932 --> 00:44:46.769
...maybe 40 Tangos coming
through the Charlie-1 gate.

741
00:44:54.943 --> 00:44:55.944
Hello?

742
00:44:56.653 --> 00:44:57.738
Hello?

743
00:44:57.821 --> 00:44:59.823
It doesn't work. Phone! I need a phone!

744
00:45:00.324 --> 00:45:02.659
Alec, call the CIA,
call the annex!

745
00:45:02.826 --> 00:45:05.621
<i>GRS, all GRS,
muster in the CP right now.</i>

746
00:45:05.954 --> 00:45:08.791
I thought it was
gonna be a peaceful night.

747
00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:14.463
State's under attack!

748
00:45:15.047 --> 00:45:17.800
State's under attack! Let's go, man.

749
00:45:29.937 --> 00:45:31.939
DS Scott, do you have
hands on the Ambo yet?

750
00:45:32.022 --> 00:45:34.358
Moving package and guest
in the safe haven.

751
00:45:34.817 --> 00:45:36.151
Get down there.

752
00:45:52.835 --> 00:45:54.355
No, I need more information than that.

753
00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:55.504
What do we got, Chief? How many?

754
00:45:55.587 --> 00:45:56.588
20 to 40 attackers.

755
00:45:56.672 --> 00:45:58.757
State personnel separated
in several positions.

756
00:46:00.592 --> 00:46:01.593
What's that?

757
00:46:01.718 --> 00:46:02.761
I hear AKs.

758
00:46:03.262 --> 00:46:04.263
RPGs.

759
00:46:12.688 --> 00:46:14.022
That's not good.

760
00:46:22.364 --> 00:46:24.324
- What do I do?
- Get back down!

761
00:46:24.408 --> 00:46:25.617
We're going back.

762
00:46:25.909 --> 00:46:27.744
What's going on out there?

763
00:46:34.418 --> 00:46:35.752
Listen up.

764
00:46:37.504 --> 00:46:39.173
None of you have to go.

765
00:46:41.133 --> 00:46:43.260
But we are the only help they have.

766
00:46:46.221 --> 00:46:48.557
2 vehicles, staged and ready.
Let's go! Move! Move!

767
00:46:51.393 --> 00:46:52.394
Are they coming in?

768
00:46:52.478 --> 00:46:53.562
Jesus! There's nowhere to hide!

769
00:46:53.645 --> 00:46:55.898
Get in the other room! Go!
Get in the other room!

770
00:46:58.984 --> 00:47:00.068
Tripoli?

771
00:47:00.402 --> 00:47:02.154
Tripoli, Benghazi is under attack.

772
00:47:02.404 --> 00:47:04.281
<i>The Ambo is in the safe haven.</i>

773
00:47:04.865 --> 00:47:06.283
<i>We are overrun.</i>

774
00:47:07.409 --> 00:47:09.578
<i>We need immediate assistance.</i>

775
00:47:10.078 --> 00:47:12.039
<i>We need some fucking help!</i>

776
00:47:18.295 --> 00:47:19.815
Magariaf pick up the phone yet?

777
00:47:19.922 --> 00:47:21.423
I got Op Center at State in D.C.

778
00:47:21.507 --> 00:47:22.841
U.S. Military AFRICOM holding.

779
00:47:22.925 --> 00:47:24.510
Yes, AFRICOM.

780
00:47:24.801 --> 00:47:26.470
Firing and chanting.

781
00:47:26.887 --> 00:47:28.722
Front gate. Local guards ran.

782
00:47:28.847 --> 00:47:31.016
20 to 40 Tangos,
that's a substantial force.

783
00:47:31.099 --> 00:47:32.643
We got to go right now, Chief.

784
00:47:32.809 --> 00:47:34.645
We have no authority at the consulate.

785
00:47:34.728 --> 00:47:36.813
We have no jurisdiction in this country.

786
00:47:36.939 --> 00:47:38.232
We're not supposed to be here.

787
00:47:38.315 --> 00:47:39.608
But we are here.

788
00:47:39.816 --> 00:47:42.216
We're coordinating with 17 Feb.
They're gonna take the point.

789
00:47:42.277 --> 00:47:44.821
Absolutely not.
You have a U.S. Ambassador at risk.

790
00:47:45.447 --> 00:47:48.450
Send us, Chief. You've got to send us.

791
00:47:48.825 --> 00:47:51.745
The Ambassador is in his safe haven
with his body man.

792
00:47:51.828 --> 00:47:53.789
You're not the first responders.

793
00:47:53.872 --> 00:47:55.332
You're the last resort.

794
00:47:55.457 --> 00:47:57.084
You will wait.

795
00:47:57.376 --> 00:47:59.628
We have no military assets in country.

796
00:47:59.753 --> 00:48:02.464
We have two paramilitary
assets in the country.

797
00:48:02.589 --> 00:48:04.466
One just a mile away
from the Ambassador.

798
00:48:04.633 --> 00:48:05.717
And the other?

799
00:48:05.926 --> 00:48:08.470
I need a bag full of money
and a flight to Benghazi.

800
00:48:18.272 --> 00:48:19.439
Scott,

801
00:48:19.856 --> 00:48:22.651
<i>there are Tangos right outside your door.</i>

802
00:48:25.404 --> 00:48:27.823
Do not move. Do not make a sound.

803
00:48:54.933 --> 00:48:56.351
- Amahl!
- Yes?

804
00:48:56.518 --> 00:48:59.354
If we link up with 17 Feb,
none of us knows the language.

805
00:48:59.438 --> 00:49:00.522
We need you, man. Come on.

806
00:49:00.647 --> 00:49:04.526
Hey, hey, what?
Tanto, I'm not a combat interpreter!

807
00:49:04.776 --> 00:49:06.862
I'm not weapons qualified.

808
00:49:07.446 --> 00:49:09.448
- What is this?
- Now you're qualified.

809
00:49:10.282 --> 00:49:12.034
Get your helmet and armor. Let's go.

810
00:49:14.828 --> 00:49:16.997
That dude ain't coming back.

811
00:49:17.122 --> 00:49:19.291
Are you actually trying to fuck me over?

812
00:49:19.541 --> 00:49:21.793
No, that's not what
I'm saying at all. Just hold on!

813
00:49:22.336 --> 00:49:23.336
Now, listen to me.

814
00:49:23.378 --> 00:49:25.422
- Losing the initiative, Chief.
- Will you just hold on?

815
00:49:25.505 --> 00:49:26.715
You're losing it.
You understand how that works?

816
00:49:26.798 --> 00:49:29.593
Stand down. Stand down!

817
00:49:30.302 --> 00:49:31.428
Wait for my word!

818
00:49:31.511 --> 00:49:33.972
At least let us get eyes on.
Then we know if we have to intervene.

819
00:49:34.056 --> 00:49:37.059
And if there's an ambush
and you get entrenched?

820
00:49:38.518 --> 00:49:40.020
Who rescues you?

821
00:49:41.063 --> 00:49:42.064
Me?

822
00:49:45.817 --> 00:49:47.653
Oz, you need
to listen to me very carefully,

823
00:49:47.861 --> 00:49:49.029
leave now.

824
00:49:49.196 --> 00:49:51.198
<i>You don't go anywhere
near the embassy.</i>

825
00:49:51.865 --> 00:49:53.492
Pardon the interruption. We need to go.

826
00:49:53.575 --> 00:49:55.410
- We've just started dinner.
- Now.

827
00:49:57.996 --> 00:49:59.581
Goddamn, you guys!
Every time I get close...

828
00:49:59.665 --> 00:50:00.745
Put your head scarf on!

829
00:50:01.249 --> 00:50:03.835
I need your
eyes and your ears, not your mouth.

830
00:50:03.919 --> 00:50:05.837
<i>Annex, we have
attackers on compound.</i>

831
00:50:05.921 --> 00:50:08.757
<i>We need immediate help.
We are under attack.</i>

832
00:50:14.304 --> 00:50:15.806
<i>Spool up all
available SpecialOps.</i>

833
00:50:15.931 --> 00:50:17.474
I want teams mobilized ASAP.

834
00:50:17.766 --> 00:50:19.893
Stage them in Sigonella, Italy.

835
00:50:20.018 --> 00:50:21.728
Have F16s ready on my command,

836
00:50:21.812 --> 00:50:24.398
and I want SITREP
on all assets in 5 minutes.

837
00:50:24.481 --> 00:50:26.358
We'll have
eyes on station in 46 minutes.

838
00:50:26.441 --> 00:50:28.819
After ingress,
we'll only have 0:45 overhead.

839
00:50:28.902 --> 00:50:30.153
We need to manage his flight.

840
00:50:30.404 --> 00:50:32.244
Keyhole tactics overhead
for close air support.

841
00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:34.658
<i>I'm just learning
we've got a classified CIA base</i>

842
00:50:34.741 --> 00:50:36.493
<i>a mile away full of Americans.</i>

843
00:50:38.245 --> 00:50:39.871
<i>POTUS is about
to be briefed.</i>

844
00:50:49.214 --> 00:50:51.174
It's bulletproof. It's bulletproof.

845
00:50:58.014 --> 00:50:59.307
What's happening?

846
00:50:59.933 --> 00:51:01.476
They might be going away.

847
00:51:02.978 --> 00:51:05.018
<i>Scott, can you get
the Ambo to an armored car?</i>

848
00:51:12.779 --> 00:51:15.031
Let's go! We got to fucking move!

849
00:51:15.407 --> 00:51:17.075
Could be the start of the Holy War.

850
00:51:17.659 --> 00:51:19.619
You gonna fight
the Holy War in your shorts?

851
00:51:21.329 --> 00:51:22.372
Strong move.

852
00:51:22.748 --> 00:51:24.416
What the fuck are we waiting for?

853
00:51:24.583 --> 00:51:25.751
We're holding.

854
00:51:25.834 --> 00:51:27.669
He's going with Feb 17 again.

855
00:51:28.003 --> 00:51:29.921
He doesn't want to expose the annex.

856
00:51:30.005 --> 00:51:31.089
Fucking mess.

857
00:51:33.175 --> 00:51:35.343
It's like a damn
fireworks show over there.

858
00:51:36.803 --> 00:51:38.889
Seriously, guys, if the consulate ordered

859
00:51:38.972 --> 00:51:41.516
a fucking pizza
it would've been there by now.

860
00:51:48.774 --> 00:51:51.109
No. Fuck you.

861
00:51:51.610 --> 00:51:54.613
<i>Scott, they are bringing
diesel cans over to the villa.</i>

862
00:51:56.531 --> 00:51:58.366
<i>Scott, they are coming inside.</i>

863
00:52:02.204 --> 00:52:04.206
<i>They're gonna burn you out.</i>

864
00:52:04.414 --> 00:52:06.082
Okay, okay.

865
00:52:06.875 --> 00:52:09.461
Get in the bathroom, crawl.
Go to the bathroom, go!

866
00:52:28.522 --> 00:52:30.857
<i>They are pouring the diesel
right by the door.</i>

867
00:52:37.531 --> 00:52:38.615
No, don't.

868
00:52:41.618 --> 00:52:43.119
Don't you fucking do it.

869
00:52:44.246 --> 00:52:45.372
Don't do it.

870
00:52:55.090 --> 00:52:56.800
Oh, God.

871
00:52:56.967 --> 00:52:57.968
Shit.

872
00:52:59.845 --> 00:53:00.846
Get the towels.

873
00:53:00.929 --> 00:53:02.264
Chris, where are the gas masks?

874
00:53:02.389 --> 00:53:03.431
Oh, God.

875
00:53:03.682 --> 00:53:05.934
I can't breathe! I can't breathe!

876
00:53:08.603 --> 00:53:10.230
<i>It's too much smoke.</i>

877
00:53:10.564 --> 00:53:13.275
<i>Chris, follow me. Follow me.</i>

878
00:53:17.946 --> 00:53:20.824
See if you can get hold of any other
quick-reaction forces in the area.

879
00:53:20.949 --> 00:53:21.950
Yes.

880
00:53:28.874 --> 00:53:30.709
Follow me! Follow!

881
00:53:40.135 --> 00:53:41.678
Jack, how bad?

882
00:54:04.284 --> 00:54:06.286
<i>GRS, where are you guys?</i>

883
00:54:06.536 --> 00:54:08.288
<i>Please help.</i>

884
00:54:09.164 --> 00:54:11.166
They're digging in now, Rone.

885
00:54:11.541 --> 00:54:12.792
We need some air support.

886
00:54:12.876 --> 00:54:15.837
A Spectre gunship, an ISR drone...
American firepower, man.

887
00:54:15.921 --> 00:54:17.505
I know what we need.

888
00:54:17.839 --> 00:54:19.299
Chief! Chief!

889
00:54:19.424 --> 00:54:20.884
20 minutes now.

890
00:54:21.801 --> 00:54:24.137
It's going from a rescue mission
to a suicide mission.

891
00:54:24.512 --> 00:54:27.098
Let us loose. Lives are at stake.

892
00:54:27.223 --> 00:54:29.017
You are not direct-action elements.

893
00:54:29.184 --> 00:54:30.226
Chief, think.

894
00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:32.228
You let them take that consulate,

895
00:54:32.395 --> 00:54:34.689
where do you think
the next target's gonna be?

896
00:54:35.815 --> 00:54:38.068
<i>Annex, we need your help.</i>

897
00:54:38.526 --> 00:54:42.447
<i>If you do not get here soon,
we are all gonna fucking die.</i>

898
00:54:43.531 --> 00:54:45.700
Amahl, get in the
fucking car now. Let's go!

899
00:54:45.825 --> 00:54:47.285
Now! Let's go!

900
00:54:47.369 --> 00:54:50.205
Amahl, stop!
Do not leave this compound, Amahl.

901
00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:52.415
Get in, Amahl. Let's go!

902
00:54:53.041 --> 00:54:54.834
Amahl! You're not cleared to go!

903
00:54:56.378 --> 00:54:58.713
God damn it! None of you are!

904
00:55:07.555 --> 00:55:09.057
Say goodbye to contract work.

905
00:55:09.516 --> 00:55:11.893
You can't put a price
on being able to live with yourself.

906
00:55:11.977 --> 00:55:13.812
<i>Tripoli, we need immediate assistance.</i>

907
00:55:14.062 --> 00:55:15.355
<i>We need fucking help now!</i>

908
00:55:15.438 --> 00:55:18.066
These assholes have no idea
what's coming for them.

909
00:55:20.110 --> 00:55:22.779
Shit. You got to be fucking kidding me.

910
00:55:22.946 --> 00:55:24.155
I lost my contact.

911
00:55:24.531 --> 00:55:26.199
Shit! I can't go if I can't see.

912
00:55:26.282 --> 00:55:27.951
You got to fix this, man.
You got to fix this right now.

913
00:55:28.076 --> 00:55:29.077
Hey, funny man, shut the fuck up.

914
00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:30.245
You know where you're going.

915
00:55:30.370 --> 00:55:31.770
- This ain't funny.
- Hold up.

916
00:55:39.421 --> 00:55:41.589
Now 17 Feb knows we're coming, right?

917
00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:45.260
And how do we know that's 17 Feb?

918
00:55:45.427 --> 00:55:46.594
Rone, what are you seeing?

919
00:55:46.928 --> 00:55:48.680
<i>We're 300 yards
from the front gate, Chief,</i>

920
00:55:48.763 --> 00:55:50.432
but there's a roadblock.

921
00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:55.729
<i>Are they friendlies? Feb 17?</i>

922
00:55:55.812 --> 00:55:57.022
Chief, trying to assess,

923
00:55:57.105 --> 00:55:58.940
but no one's wearing
fucking uniforms here.

924
00:56:01.067 --> 00:56:02.819
Come on. Come on.

925
00:56:04.154 --> 00:56:05.238
Oh...

926
00:56:05.321 --> 00:56:08.158
I didn't get here
late just to die in friendly fire.

927
00:56:08.241 --> 00:56:09.242
Use your gun.

928
00:56:09.492 --> 00:56:12.245
Find out who the commander is
and get this organized quick. Go.

929
00:56:12.328 --> 00:56:13.371
Go.

930
00:56:28.094 --> 00:56:29.596
Stop!

931
00:56:35.810 --> 00:56:37.479
Amahl, get cover!

932
00:57:03.171 --> 00:57:04.589
- Chief!
- <i>Please help.</i>

933
00:57:04.672 --> 00:57:06.007
Get the Chief!

934
00:57:08.384 --> 00:57:10.386
- Are they gone? Yeah?
- Yeah.

935
00:57:11.596 --> 00:57:13.932
I had the rest of the staff
cover in their quarters.

936
00:57:14.015 --> 00:57:15.558
Okay, Bob, Bob, listen to me.

937
00:57:15.642 --> 00:57:17.727
I want 100% accountability. All right?

938
00:57:17.811 --> 00:57:19.813
We're gonna harden
our defenses here in C.

939
00:57:19.896 --> 00:57:20.939
This is gonna be our fallback.

940
00:57:21.022 --> 00:57:24.109
Hey, lock this building down!
You, you, let's go. Let's go.

941
00:57:27.070 --> 00:57:28.113
Do it.

942
00:57:28.238 --> 00:57:29.239
How can I help?

943
00:57:40.583 --> 00:57:41.918
We're pushing forward.

944
00:57:42.085 --> 00:57:43.253
Got to move, got to move.

945
00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:06.109
8 to 10 Tangos, front gate.

946
00:58:06.192 --> 00:58:09.195
50/50 these guys turn on us
and end this now.

947
00:58:09.362 --> 00:58:10.864
Tanto! Let's get up high.

948
00:58:10.989 --> 00:58:11.990
Rone!

949
00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:13.324
This road's a chokepoint.

950
00:58:13.575 --> 00:58:15.743
We'll get established,
let you know when it's clear to advance.

951
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:17.203
We're getting
our heavy weapons. Be back.

952
00:58:17.287 --> 00:58:20.498
Tig, get Amahl.
Tell 17 Feb to lock down this road.

953
00:58:20.582 --> 00:58:21.791
I don't want anybody
coming over here, all right?

954
00:58:21.875 --> 00:58:23.418
- Let's go! Now!
- Roger that.

955
00:58:28.173 --> 00:58:29.293
Check this dude out.

956
00:58:32.468 --> 00:58:34.470
Lucky we got that guy on our side.

957
00:58:36.764 --> 00:58:38.725
- Hey, check these guys.
- Hi.

958
00:58:39.976 --> 00:58:41.186
Hey.

959
00:58:41.269 --> 00:58:43.188
- You 17 Feb?
- Yeah.

960
00:58:43.771 --> 00:58:45.273
Well, shit, come on, let's go.

961
00:58:46.691 --> 00:58:48.276
4 guys is a fireteam, bro.

962
00:58:49.277 --> 00:58:51.112
Just don't shoot us in the back.

963
00:58:52.697 --> 00:58:53.907
Scott!

964
00:58:54.157 --> 00:58:56.284
Chris! Chris!

965
00:58:56.534 --> 00:58:58.214
I can't breathe.

966
00:59:01.039 --> 00:59:02.123
Chris!

967
00:59:02.373 --> 00:59:03.708
Chris!

968
00:59:06.461 --> 00:59:07.545
Tango approaching.

969
00:59:09.964 --> 00:59:10.965
<i>Tanto, get back.
We gotta move.</i>

970
00:59:11.132 --> 00:59:12.133
Contact, front!

971
00:59:14.135 --> 00:59:15.845
RPG.

972
00:59:15.929 --> 00:59:17.180
Incoming!

973
00:59:17.263 --> 00:59:18.556
Oh, shit!

974
00:59:25.146 --> 00:59:27.066
- Get cover, get cover!
- Move right, move right!

975
00:59:28.983 --> 00:59:30.401
Left! By the trees!

976
00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:36.324
Ty, to the right!

977
00:59:37.367 --> 00:59:38.701
Move, move, move!

978
00:59:38.785 --> 00:59:40.870
Tanto, move.
Go, go, hustle!

979
00:59:43.998 --> 00:59:46.000
<i>We're pushing
forward to the front gate.</i>

980
00:59:50.004 --> 00:59:51.214
Might want to get inside.

981
00:59:51.297 --> 00:59:53.508
Wonder if they can
get the Broncos game?

982
00:59:55.051 --> 00:59:56.219
Get high, get high.

983
00:59:57.512 --> 00:59:59.681
I'm too fucking old to be climbing walls.

984
01:00:04.394 --> 01:00:05.395
Come on.

985
01:00:05.478 --> 01:00:08.022
Jesus Christ, get your
gun out of my face, bro. Fuck!

986
01:00:08.815 --> 01:00:10.483
Fucking amateur hour, man.

987
01:00:10.650 --> 01:00:12.777
Is he inside? Is the Ambo inside?

988
01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:17.699
Is Sean inside? Scott, think.
Where did you see him last?

989
01:00:17.949 --> 01:00:20.451
Let's get to the top
of this building. Let's go!

990
01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:36.718
Up here we can cross over
to the bigger building.

991
01:00:36.884 --> 01:00:37.885
<i>Guys,
I need your eyes quick.</i>

992
01:00:38.011 --> 01:00:40.054
Copy that, Rone.
We are coming as fast as we can.

993
01:00:40.388 --> 01:00:41.889
<i>Easy. I got 4 Tangos.</i>

994
01:00:43.891 --> 01:00:45.251
Who the fuck are these guys?

995
01:00:46.019 --> 01:00:47.228
You are Americans?

996
01:00:47.562 --> 01:00:48.896
Yes.

997
01:00:52.483 --> 01:00:54.003
These guys are watching a soccer game.

998
01:00:54.736 --> 01:00:57.030
Just another Tuesday night in Benghazi.

999
01:00:59.907 --> 01:01:02.368
<i>We need sniper over-watch
fast. You got to move it!</i>

1000
01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:06.164
We're blocked by buildings.
We got no vantage point.

1001
01:01:06.873 --> 01:01:07.874
Fuck.

1002
01:01:08.207 --> 01:01:12.086
Rone, this roost is a bust.
We're gonna keep moving.

1003
01:01:14.172 --> 01:01:16.174
<i>Making our way
to the front gate.</i>

1004
01:01:16.257 --> 01:01:17.925
Feb 17 is rolling with us.

1005
01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:23.340
Check those guys on the left.

1006
01:01:36.402 --> 01:01:39.405
<i>Tig, technical!
Knock out that technical!</i>

1007
01:01:48.373 --> 01:01:51.250
<i>Tig, you got to knock out
that technical right fucking now, man!</i>

1008
01:01:56.631 --> 01:01:58.716
Tig, drop that technical or we're dead!

1009
01:02:09.310 --> 01:02:10.978
Move, move, move!

1010
01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:16.109
Rone, we've been
running about a mile so far.

1011
01:02:16.442 --> 01:02:18.778
Making it around
to the back gate of the compound.

1012
01:02:18.986 --> 01:02:20.530
On the GPS,
where are our teams?

1013
01:02:20.655 --> 01:02:22.240
They should be coming back this way.

1014
01:02:22.323 --> 01:02:23.491
Look, they're right here.

1015
01:02:23.616 --> 01:02:25.576
Tanto and Boon
are on Gunfighter Road at the back.

1016
01:02:25.618 --> 01:02:27.578
Rone's team is about
to enter the front gate.

1017
01:02:38.172 --> 01:02:40.842
Hello, Captain America.
I'm fighting for my country.

1018
01:02:44.429 --> 01:02:45.555
You're welcome.

1019
01:02:49.267 --> 01:02:50.768
Guess we're going in.

1020
01:02:54.021 --> 01:02:55.440
State, we're on property!

1021
01:03:04.949 --> 01:03:07.285
State, we're coming in!
We're on property!

1022
01:03:08.202 --> 01:03:09.787
<i>Delta Pred checking in on station.</i>

1023
01:03:09.871 --> 01:03:12.331
<i>We'll have eyes on in 2 minutes.</i>

1024
01:03:13.624 --> 01:03:15.042
Hey, talk to me, guys.
Where are they?

1025
01:03:15.126 --> 01:03:16.711
I looked everywhere.
I can't find them.

1026
01:03:16.878 --> 01:03:18.463
I think they're still in there.

1027
01:03:18.546 --> 01:03:20.214
You got bad guys inside?

1028
01:03:20.381 --> 01:03:22.550
We got separated. I can't find them.

1029
01:03:22.717 --> 01:03:24.343
- Our guys? How many?
- Two.

1030
01:03:26.304 --> 01:03:27.305
God!

1031
01:03:29.891 --> 01:03:33.227
It's too hot!
Go around that way. That room.

1032
01:03:33.644 --> 01:03:35.480
- Over here?
- There.

1033
01:03:42.153 --> 01:03:43.738
Chris! Shit.

1034
01:03:44.071 --> 01:03:45.823
Jack, come here!

1035
01:03:46.157 --> 01:03:47.241
Let's go in.

1036
01:03:47.533 --> 01:03:49.243
Ready? Okay, go in.

1037
01:03:52.997 --> 01:03:55.082
Chris!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1038
01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:00.421
No one could survive that.

1039
01:04:01.422 --> 01:04:02.673
Let's go.

1040
01:04:05.593 --> 01:04:07.345
Ambo!
Chris Stevens!

1041
01:04:07.678 --> 01:04:09.597
- Ambo!
- Chris!

1042
01:04:10.431 --> 01:04:11.599
- Chris!
- Chris!

1043
01:04:16.062 --> 01:04:18.272
Shit, I got to do more cardio.

1044
01:04:25.905 --> 01:04:27.323
Should be bad guys coming out here.

1045
01:04:27.448 --> 01:04:28.908
Maybe they already came through.

1046
01:04:29.242 --> 01:04:30.701
<i>Phantom Cyclops.</i>

1047
01:04:30.785 --> 01:04:34.747
<i>I have two friendlies,
IR strobed, back gate of the compound.</i>

1048
01:04:35.248 --> 01:04:38.584
Hey, we are coming
over the back gate. Do not shoot.

1049
01:04:39.961 --> 01:04:43.047
Hey, those guys we just
passed at the cafe? Are they with us?

1050
01:04:44.090 --> 01:04:46.092
- Friendlies?
- No, mister, no.

1051
01:04:46.634 --> 01:04:47.760
We're going over the wall.

1052
01:04:47.885 --> 01:04:48.970
Yes, sir.

1053
01:04:49.136 --> 01:04:50.137
If they shoot at us...

1054
01:04:50.304 --> 01:04:51.305
Yes, sir.

1055
01:04:51.639 --> 01:04:53.641
- ...you kill them.
- Okay, mister. Okay.

1056
01:04:53.933 --> 01:04:54.934
Chris!

1057
01:04:55.476 --> 01:04:56.811
Chris!

1058
01:04:57.144 --> 01:04:58.229
Chris!

1059
01:04:58.312 --> 01:04:59.397
God!

1060
01:05:01.899 --> 01:05:03.317
Chris!

1061
01:05:03.401 --> 01:05:05.111
Chris Stevens!

1062
01:05:12.994 --> 01:05:16.831
Tanto, it's like
a goddamn block party out here.

1063
01:05:17.123 --> 01:05:18.749
Get in here, dude.

1064
01:05:27.925 --> 01:05:29.260
You 17 Feb?

1065
01:05:29.427 --> 01:05:31.053
- I'm a commander.
- Good for you.

1066
01:05:31.137 --> 01:05:33.764
Once you get all your guys through here,
you got to close this gate, okay?

1067
01:05:33.848 --> 01:05:35.182
- Okay? All right.
- Okay.

1068
01:05:37.018 --> 01:05:39.186
Wait. Who are you talking to?

1069
01:05:40.271 --> 01:05:41.772
Who's on the phone?

1070
01:05:41.856 --> 01:05:42.857
Okay.

1071
01:05:43.024 --> 01:05:45.401
I call attackers.
Maybe I negotiate surrender.

1072
01:05:45.484 --> 01:05:47.028
Wait. You called the attackers?
You have their phone...

1073
01:05:47.111 --> 01:05:49.030
How the fuck do you
have their phone number?

1074
01:05:49.196 --> 01:05:50.865
I now a good boy.

1075
01:05:51.324 --> 01:05:53.326
But I know bad guys.

1076
01:05:54.535 --> 01:05:56.454
- What?
- <i>Tanto, get in here. We need you.</i>

1077
01:05:56.537 --> 01:05:58.789
Yeah, dude, I know, I know, I'm coming.

1078
01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:00.875
Follow my voice!

1079
01:06:01.042 --> 01:06:02.627
Jack, keep talking!

1080
01:06:02.752 --> 01:06:04.337
Ty, follow my voice!

1081
01:06:04.712 --> 01:06:06.632
- Okay. Where are you?
- Follow my voice!

1082
01:06:09.050 --> 01:06:10.551
Jack! Jack, I can't see!

1083
01:06:10.843 --> 01:06:11.969
Ty!

1084
01:06:16.682 --> 01:06:17.850
Go, go, go.

1085
01:06:29.570 --> 01:06:30.821
Amahl!

1086
01:06:30.905 --> 01:06:32.990
Hey, I brought these 17 guys, okay?

1087
01:06:33.074 --> 01:06:35.534
But I do think these

1088
01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:37.995
assholes, they were
trying to steal our cars.

1089
01:06:39.163 --> 01:06:40.915
They were the dudes
who were supposed to take point.

1090
01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:42.166
Yeah.

1091
01:06:42.249 --> 01:06:45.002
Now, this is fucking bad.

1092
01:06:50.925 --> 01:06:53.594
Rone, we're in the back of
the compound, we're going to the TOC.

1093
01:06:53.678 --> 01:06:55.179
Oh, shit.

1094
01:06:56.347 --> 01:06:59.016
Jesus Christ, that shit is torched.

1095
01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:00.518
Who are these guys?

1096
01:07:00.893 --> 01:07:01.894
Whoa.

1097
01:07:07.358 --> 01:07:09.276
Soldiers! Americans are in trouble!

1098
01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:10.361
Huh?

1099
01:07:10.444 --> 01:07:12.446
Your Americans are in trouble!

1100
01:07:13.531 --> 01:07:15.116
Go, go, go. Go!

1101
01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:17.952
Go, go, go.

1102
01:07:19.954 --> 01:07:21.080
Who is it?

1103
01:07:22.289 --> 01:07:25.126
It's Sean Smith, our IT guy.

1104
01:07:25.459 --> 01:07:26.585
Let's go. Hold him up.

1105
01:07:32.925 --> 01:07:34.635
Tig, med bag!

1106
01:07:39.098 --> 01:07:40.766
I was just with him.

1107
01:07:41.058 --> 01:07:42.727
I was just with him.

1108
01:07:42.977 --> 01:07:44.645
GRS moving in on the TOC.

1109
01:07:54.447 --> 01:07:57.158
Hey, we're outside the TOC.
Door's locked. Anybody in there? Over.

1110
01:07:57.324 --> 01:07:58.784
That's it. He's gone.

1111
01:08:00.161 --> 01:08:02.413
- He's gone.
- No!

1112
01:08:02.496 --> 01:08:03.664
He's gone. Now is not the time.

1113
01:08:03.748 --> 01:08:04.749
- Get yourself together, Tig.
- No.

1114
01:08:04.832 --> 01:08:06.392
Don't waste your energy, man.
He's gone.

1115
01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:09.128
Jack, let's get his body in the vehicle.

1116
01:08:10.921 --> 01:08:12.089
Pick him up.

1117
01:08:12.423 --> 01:08:13.924
All right, move.

1118
01:08:15.009 --> 01:08:17.178
Explain to me
how all these guys are friendlies.

1119
01:08:17.344 --> 01:08:18.637
Funny, I don't know.

1120
01:08:18.763 --> 01:08:20.097
Funny? It's not that funny.

1121
01:08:21.682 --> 01:08:22.767
Who are you?

1122
01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:24.852
What are you doing,
coming out of the bushes like that?

1123
01:08:25.144 --> 01:08:27.980
Hey, inside the TOC,
do you see us? We need to come in.

1124
01:08:28.147 --> 01:08:29.356
You know that thing
where the initial assault

1125
01:08:29.482 --> 01:08:32.651
is just a ploy to draw people
in for the real attack?

1126
01:08:33.152 --> 01:08:34.320
Jesus Christ.

1127
01:08:34.487 --> 01:08:36.864
Open your door
or I'm gonna fucking blow it open!

1128
01:08:37.031 --> 01:08:38.616
Blue.

1129
01:08:38.699 --> 01:08:39.700
CIA!

1130
01:08:40.326 --> 01:08:41.368
Whoa! Hey!

1131
01:08:41.452 --> 01:08:43.871
Easy, Forrest Gump! We need you.

1132
01:08:43.954 --> 01:08:45.122
Is there anybody else inside?

1133
01:08:45.247 --> 01:08:46.373
No, no.

1134
01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:48.220
- Glad you're here, brother.
- Yeah, buddy.

1135
01:08:52.129 --> 01:08:55.674
Hey. Hey. They're coming back!

1136
01:08:55.841 --> 01:08:58.677
They said the attackers are regrouping,
adding reinforcements.

1137
01:08:59.178 --> 01:09:00.846
Coming back to finish the job?

1138
01:09:01.013 --> 01:09:02.389
Jack, help get State's classifieds
out of the TOC.

1139
01:09:02.473 --> 01:09:03.849
I'm gonna get DS out of here.

1140
01:09:05.559 --> 01:09:06.894
You better hurry up.

1141
01:09:08.312 --> 01:09:10.231
Amahl, follow me. Let's go.

1142
01:09:10.815 --> 01:09:13.150
Tanto, we got a situation
coming our way.

1143
01:09:13.484 --> 01:09:15.653
DS! Get in your car.

1144
01:09:17.530 --> 01:09:19.240
Tanto, blue, blue!

1145
01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:20.991
Boon's inside. Go.

1146
01:09:25.663 --> 01:09:27.581
Jack, what's going on over there?

1147
01:09:27.748 --> 01:09:28.916
It's not good.

1148
01:09:29.583 --> 01:09:32.294
We got one KIA.
We got guys still in the bushes.

1149
01:09:32.378 --> 01:09:33.420
No Ambo.

1150
01:09:34.755 --> 01:09:36.257
They're still here.

1151
01:09:36.423 --> 01:09:38.259
I think we got hostiles everywhere.

1152
01:09:38.425 --> 01:09:40.761
The fire has just got to be cover.

1153
01:09:41.053 --> 01:09:44.598
They have control of the compound.
Why else leave so fast?

1154
01:09:44.765 --> 01:09:46.100
Black Hawk Down, man.

1155
01:09:46.725 --> 01:09:48.769
They're gonna drag
his body through the streets.

1156
01:09:49.353 --> 01:09:51.939
Amahl. Hey.

1157
01:09:52.439 --> 01:09:54.191
Amahl, pull it together, man. Come on.

1158
01:09:56.068 --> 01:09:57.570
Come here. Stop pointing your gun!

1159
01:09:58.612 --> 01:09:59.780
We ready?

1160
01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:01.448
On me. Here we go.

1161
01:10:01.615 --> 01:10:02.992
Let's go. Amahl, out.

1162
01:10:07.454 --> 01:10:10.958
Oh! Goddamn it!
This cockbag motherfucker!

1163
01:10:11.292 --> 01:10:13.711
Be advised the 17 Feb
tactical genius commander

1164
01:10:13.794 --> 01:10:15.462
left the back gate wide fucking open.

1165
01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:19.133
All right, Boon,
this wall set as new perimeter.

1166
01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:21.468
Take cover, hold it.
We're getting DS out of here.

1167
01:10:21.552 --> 01:10:23.095
Let's go! Move!

1168
01:10:23.929 --> 01:10:26.473
Go inside, please. Go back inside.

1169
01:10:26.807 --> 01:10:29.143
Get in the house right now! In the house!

1170
01:10:29.310 --> 01:10:30.978
Fire sale! Everything must go.

1171
01:10:31.145 --> 01:10:33.063
We got a large group
of bad guys headed our way.

1172
01:10:33.147 --> 01:10:35.524
We're gonna stay and look for the Ambo.
You guys need to exfil.

1173
01:10:35.608 --> 01:10:37.276
We're short two guys.

1174
01:10:37.484 --> 01:10:39.904
I got two more agents,
and I'm not leaving them.

1175
01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:41.990
Hey, Tanto, what's going on, man?
We got to move.

1176
01:10:45.117 --> 01:10:46.243
You dumb piece of shit!

1177
01:10:46.327 --> 01:10:48.621
You blew yourself up
trying to frag us, huh?

1178
01:10:49.663 --> 01:10:50.706
17 Feb?

1179
01:10:50.789 --> 01:10:51.790
Yes!

1180
01:10:54.126 --> 01:10:55.336
Fuck.

1181
01:10:55.961 --> 01:10:57.004
Oh, shit!

1182
01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:15.481
Boon! Let's go back!

1183
01:11:30.996 --> 01:11:32.831
Jack, watch our 6!

1184
01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:43.509
All right. Listen to me.
Listen, hey. Listen up!

1185
01:11:43.676 --> 01:11:46.220
When you go outside that gate,
you go left, you understand?

1186
01:11:46.345 --> 01:11:47.388
- Yes.
- You understand?

1187
01:11:49.223 --> 01:11:50.349
Haul ass!

1188
01:11:51.225 --> 01:11:52.977
Hey! Hey! Hurry up!

1189
01:11:53.185 --> 01:11:54.812
Let's go! Let's go! Move, move, move!

1190
01:11:54.895 --> 01:11:55.896
Let's move!

1191
01:11:57.064 --> 01:11:59.400
To the right is bad guys.
You are going left.

1192
01:11:59.483 --> 01:12:00.734
You're taking the back way to the annex.

1193
01:12:00.818 --> 01:12:01.819
- You got it?
- I got it.

1194
01:12:01.902 --> 01:12:02.987
Listen, I think somebody else
should drive.

1195
01:12:03.070 --> 01:12:04.113
No, I'm driving!

1196
01:12:04.363 --> 01:12:06.073
Blue! Blue!

1197
01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:07.574
No, don't shoot!

1198
01:12:09.243 --> 01:12:11.043
Move, move, move, move.

1199
01:12:11.704 --> 01:12:13.080
Second wave is coming!

1200
01:12:13.205 --> 01:12:14.581
They're flooding in
through the back gate!

1201
01:12:14.748 --> 01:12:16.333
Peel it! Peel it! Peel it!

1202
01:12:16.458 --> 01:12:18.085
Someone cover us on the roof!

1203
01:12:18.669 --> 01:12:21.839
Amahl, on Tig! Let's get these guys out.

1204
01:12:23.674 --> 01:12:25.759
I'm on the roof. Don't leave me.

1205
01:12:28.095 --> 01:12:31.473
State. We are exfilling
the compound, minus the Ambo.

1206
01:12:35.769 --> 01:12:37.730
No, no, no, he said go left.

1207
01:12:38.272 --> 01:12:39.273
Left!

1208
01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:41.525
- Scott, left.
- No, he said right.

1209
01:12:41.692 --> 01:12:43.277
Go back the other way.

1210
01:12:43.944 --> 01:12:45.696
- Hey, get out of the way!
- Back right.

1211
01:12:46.530 --> 01:12:48.115
Left! Go left!

1212
01:12:50.075 --> 01:12:51.285
Go! Go!

1213
01:12:51.452 --> 01:12:52.619
Move, move, move.

1214
01:12:54.246 --> 01:12:55.622
Who's this fucking guy?

1215
01:12:55.706 --> 01:12:56.957
I don't know. Maybe he's 17 Feb.

1216
01:12:57.041 --> 01:12:58.292
Maybe he's friendly. Maybe he's saying

1217
01:12:58.459 --> 01:12:59.859
go the other way. Go the other way.

1218
01:13:01.295 --> 01:13:03.213
No! Left!

1219
01:13:03.964 --> 01:13:06.967
Go left! Go left! Left!

1220
01:13:07.468 --> 01:13:09.303
I can't believe we left without him.

1221
01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:11.110
<i>You're going the wrong way.</i>

1222
01:13:12.139 --> 01:13:13.932
<i>Jack, get up here on roof.</i>

1223
01:13:23.776 --> 01:13:25.152
Tig, on your right.

1224
01:13:31.492 --> 01:13:33.118
Down road, back gate.

1225
01:13:33.494 --> 01:13:34.953
Tangos left.

1226
01:13:37.623 --> 01:13:39.343
Hey. No way these guys
are in for the night.

1227
01:13:39.416 --> 01:13:42.669
They got a little taste of victory.
The annex is next.

1228
01:13:42.836 --> 01:13:45.631
Tanto, Boon, consolidate.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1229
01:13:47.841 --> 01:13:49.343
Let's go!

1230
01:13:50.677 --> 01:13:51.678
Exfil!

1231
01:13:54.681 --> 01:13:56.058
Get that door open!

1232
01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:07.486
That was intense.

1233
01:14:08.028 --> 01:14:09.696
I forgot the grenade launcher.

1234
01:14:10.364 --> 01:14:13.033
<i>We got a mover.
State armored car leaving compound.</i>

1235
01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:15.869
<i>Target vehicle
intercept. Downrange 22 degrees.</i>

1236
01:14:15.953 --> 01:14:17.204
<i>Stand by for words.</i>

1237
01:14:22.209 --> 01:14:24.378
We just went in a circle, Scott.

1238
01:14:27.798 --> 01:14:28.882
What is this shit?

1239
01:14:29.007 --> 01:14:30.050
Who is this?

1240
01:14:32.469 --> 01:14:33.554
What is he saying?

1241
01:14:33.846 --> 01:14:35.848
This is a bad idea. Just go.

1242
01:14:38.350 --> 01:14:39.518
<i>Target vehicle has stopped.</i>

1243
01:14:39.601 --> 01:14:41.228
<i>Tangos converging from all sides.</i>

1244
01:14:41.395 --> 01:14:43.397
Who the fuck is this guy?
Who is this guy?

1245
01:14:43.814 --> 01:14:44.898
Who are you?

1246
01:14:46.817 --> 01:14:49.319
He's doing this.
I think he's trying to say he's friendly.

1247
01:14:49.403 --> 01:14:51.071
No, we don't know these guys.
This is not safe.

1248
01:14:52.322 --> 01:14:53.532
We don't know them.
We're not safe here.

1249
01:14:53.615 --> 01:14:55.534
2 guys on the balcony.
2 guys on the balcony.

1250
01:14:55.617 --> 01:14:56.827
We need to get out of here.

1251
01:14:56.910 --> 01:14:57.953
Who is that?

1252
01:14:58.036 --> 01:15:00.116
It's a trap, Dave,
it's an ambush! We've got to move!

1253
01:15:02.791 --> 01:15:05.002
He might be trying
to keep us from an ambush.

1254
01:15:05.085 --> 01:15:06.170
Who are you?

1255
01:15:06.253 --> 01:15:07.588
Back up while we can.
Back up while we can.

1256
01:15:07.671 --> 01:15:08.672
Who are you?

1257
01:15:11.925 --> 01:15:15.095
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

1258
01:15:21.435 --> 01:15:23.687
Go, go, go! Push through!

1259
01:15:27.941 --> 01:15:29.776
Keep going!
Keep going! Keep going!

1260
01:15:36.450 --> 01:15:38.530
Go to the right!
Go to the right! Go right! Go right!

1261
01:15:45.209 --> 01:15:46.210
Damn it.

1262
01:15:53.926 --> 01:15:55.552
Run them the fuck over!

1263
01:16:20.327 --> 01:16:22.663
We've got three cars
coming up on our ass fast!

1264
01:16:26.917 --> 01:16:28.502
Punch it, punch it!

1265
01:16:33.006 --> 01:16:34.549
<i>Light fire pursuit of target vehicle</i>

1266
01:16:34.633 --> 01:16:35.884
<i>half-click south of annex.</i>

1267
01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:41.348
State. We're under heavy fire!
We're on run-flats!

1268
01:16:43.350 --> 01:16:46.353
AK coming up eight o'clock!
This window's not gonna hold!

1269
01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:47.854
Shoot that son of a bitch!

1270
01:16:50.274 --> 01:16:51.275
Shoot him!

1271
01:16:59.199 --> 01:17:00.367
RPG!

1272
01:17:01.994 --> 01:17:03.203
Coming in!

1273
01:17:13.463 --> 01:17:14.965
Hey, easy, Rone. Try to blend.

1274
01:17:15.048 --> 01:17:16.049
We are.

1275
01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:19.720
With a dead body in the back,
bunch of heavily armed operators

1276
01:17:20.053 --> 01:17:22.514
just going back to hide
in our covert CIA base.

1277
01:17:23.348 --> 01:17:24.349
Hey, we got a tail.

1278
01:17:28.729 --> 01:17:29.730
2 of them.

1279
01:17:29.896 --> 01:17:32.733
<i>Annex, we got a tail.
2 or 3 vehicles in pursuit.</i>

1280
01:17:34.568 --> 01:17:37.404
Start the destruction phase.
Plan to evacuate.

1281
01:17:38.071 --> 01:17:39.072
Hit it, Rone.

1282
01:17:44.745 --> 01:17:45.912
How we looking?

1283
01:17:46.079 --> 01:17:48.248
- You lost them, Rone.
- You lost them. You're good.

1284
01:17:48.332 --> 01:17:49.333
- You sure?
- Yep. Yep.

1285
01:17:49.416 --> 01:17:51.418
That's because he knows where we live.

1286
01:17:52.085 --> 01:17:54.087
Guard, get in the tower!

1287
01:17:54.921 --> 01:17:56.923
Chef, you ready to get in the fight?

1288
01:17:57.090 --> 01:18:00.510
Anyone comes over these walls tonight,
we're kicking some ass.

1289
01:18:02.512 --> 01:18:03.930
Keep moving. Keep moving.

1290
01:18:04.097 --> 01:18:06.266
Contact rear! Go, go, go, go!

1291
01:18:10.771 --> 01:18:11.938
We're coming in hot.

1292
01:18:12.022 --> 01:18:13.607
We're closing in at about 100 meters.

1293
01:18:18.111 --> 01:18:19.780
Let's go! Shut the gate!

1294
01:18:26.703 --> 01:18:30.374
Hey! Hey, get back inside!
Get back! Now!

1295
01:18:31.458 --> 01:18:32.959
Go back inside.

1296
01:18:33.251 --> 01:18:35.379
Vinnie, give me a hand.
Let's get him to medical.

1297
01:18:35.462 --> 01:18:37.422
Go. Take him.

1298
01:18:38.090 --> 01:18:39.090
Does that need attention?

1299
01:18:39.132 --> 01:18:40.425
No, no. I'm good. It's a flesh wound.

1300
01:18:40.592 --> 01:18:41.927
Let me do something to help.

1301
01:18:42.052 --> 01:18:44.596
I need men east side. Take Building D.

1302
01:18:44.805 --> 01:18:46.640
We need all the help we can get.
Let's go.

1303
01:18:47.349 --> 01:18:49.768
You guys got the gate? Gate!

1304
01:18:58.860 --> 01:19:01.530
Hey. I had extra ammo
brought up to the rooftops.

1305
01:19:01.696 --> 01:19:03.698
Libyan guards are positioned
in the towers.

1306
01:19:03.865 --> 01:19:05.367
Should've turned left.

1307
01:19:06.159 --> 01:19:07.828
Get some water and reload!

1308
01:19:14.126 --> 01:19:15.502
Who's gonna bring him inside?

1309
01:19:15.585 --> 01:19:17.129
He stays right here, Chief.

1310
01:19:17.504 --> 01:19:19.506
When we exfil out, it's gonna be quick.

1311
01:19:19.756 --> 01:19:21.425
What about the Ambassador?

1312
01:19:24.511 --> 01:19:26.096
No one could survive that.

1313
01:19:26.179 --> 01:19:27.597
Right now, we need men on the roof.

1314
01:19:27.764 --> 01:19:29.266
I want to make a run for the airport.

1315
01:19:29.349 --> 01:19:30.392
Maybe you haven't noticed

1316
01:19:30.475 --> 01:19:32.894
it's open season on Americans
in Benghazi right now.

1317
01:19:35.313 --> 01:19:36.314
Rone.

1318
01:19:37.107 --> 01:19:38.316
Every extra mag loaded now.

1319
01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:40.610
Don't take your eyes off
the exterior cameras.

1320
01:19:40.777 --> 01:19:43.363
Rone, you realize if we stay here
that we are screwed.

1321
01:19:43.530 --> 01:19:45.782
Then why don't you get us
some fucking help, Bob?

1322
01:19:45.949 --> 01:19:48.285
Tell AFRICOM you're calling
from that classified base

1323
01:19:48.368 --> 01:19:50.048
they didn't know existed
until an hour ago.

1324
01:19:50.495 --> 01:19:53.457
You be very specific. You get
a Spectre gunship and an ISR Pred.

1325
01:19:56.376 --> 01:19:59.212
There is a drone from Derna
overhead right now.

1326
01:19:59.713 --> 01:20:01.673
The gunship is out of fueling range.

1327
01:20:01.798 --> 01:20:03.758
That's what they're telling me.

1328
01:20:03.842 --> 01:20:05.385
I'm ordering the evacuation.

1329
01:20:06.052 --> 01:20:09.055
You're not giving orders anymore,
you're taking them.

1330
01:20:09.306 --> 01:20:10.640
You're in my world now.

1331
01:20:18.398 --> 01:20:20.734
I... I tried to find him.

1332
01:20:28.074 --> 01:20:29.534
No gunship?

1333
01:20:34.247 --> 01:20:38.084
6 hours till dawn.
Entire city knows where we're holed up.

1334
01:20:38.668 --> 01:20:41.421
When they come,
we're gonna unleash hate on these guys.

1335
01:20:44.758 --> 01:20:46.426
Let's set our priorities.

1336
01:20:46.593 --> 01:20:48.428
We're gonna continue
our base destruction protocol

1337
01:20:48.512 --> 01:20:49.596
until it is finished.

1338
01:20:49.763 --> 01:20:51.515
We're gonna exfil from here
in 30 to 40 minutes.

1339
01:20:51.598 --> 01:20:53.758
We're gonna go directly
to the airport and get a plane.

1340
01:20:53.892 --> 01:20:54.935
If that doesn't work,

1341
01:20:55.018 --> 01:20:57.538
we're gonna go to the port and
we're gonna steal a fucking boat.

1342
01:20:58.438 --> 01:21:01.191
If any one of you gets separated
from the group at any time,

1343
01:21:01.274 --> 01:21:02.442
memorize this number.

1344
01:21:02.901 --> 01:21:05.654
The CIA satellites
will pick you up where you are located.

1345
01:21:06.196 --> 01:21:09.356
If there's anyone who has local assets
with friendly militias, raise your hands.

1346
01:21:10.033 --> 01:21:12.536
You need to assure me
that those people are safe.

1347
01:21:12.702 --> 01:21:14.996
They're gonna secure our exit
and escort us out of here.

1348
01:21:15.372 --> 01:21:17.040
Call them right now, immediately.

1349
01:21:17.207 --> 01:21:18.847
I want all heads of department over here.

1350
01:21:18.917 --> 01:21:22.045
And I want a fucking war room.
We're gonna make our finalized plans.

1351
01:21:22.254 --> 01:21:24.381
Now, listen, listen.
You're trained to do this.

1352
01:21:24.464 --> 01:21:27.092
It's your job. You can do it.

1353
01:21:27.175 --> 01:21:28.802
We're all responsible for our lives,

1354
01:21:28.927 --> 01:21:30.887
and what you do right now in this room

1355
01:21:31.012 --> 01:21:32.973
will determine whether we live or die.

1356
01:21:38.103 --> 01:21:40.146
Tripoli, we're here,
getting on the oil executive's jet.

1357
01:21:41.773 --> 01:21:45.110
GRS is back safe. Compound's lost.
Still no sign of the Ambo.

1358
01:21:45.277 --> 01:21:47.904
State's already blaming Al-Sharia.

1359
01:21:47.988 --> 01:21:50.740
You're with Delta? What, just two of you?

1360
01:21:50.824 --> 01:21:51.866
We're it, brother.

1361
01:21:51.992 --> 01:21:53.076
Okay.

1362
01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:54.995
That sucks.

1363
01:21:57.163 --> 01:21:59.499
There's our bird! Let's move.

1364
01:22:05.005 --> 01:22:07.286
That's supposed
to be a phone number, and it's not.

1365
01:22:07.841 --> 01:22:10.343
You need to translate this right now.

1366
01:22:15.015 --> 01:22:16.683
Did you get these?

1367
01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:18.685
Destroy those.

1368
01:22:19.436 --> 01:22:21.354
Listen, listen!
I'm having trouble hearing you,

1369
01:22:21.479 --> 01:22:23.857
but our sources
are checking every hospital.

1370
01:22:25.692 --> 01:22:29.571
Have you alerted the Pentagon
and CIA? Are they talking?

1371
01:22:29.654 --> 01:22:30.780
Amahl!

1372
01:22:35.827 --> 01:22:38.121
Amahl, what did you see? Are you hurt?

1373
01:22:38.705 --> 01:22:40.123
Amahl, what's happening out there?

1374
01:22:40.206 --> 01:22:41.926
- It's so bad. It's not good.
- Amahl!

1375
01:22:42.167 --> 01:22:44.169
Amahl, can I get my gun?

1376
01:22:44.336 --> 01:22:46.171
Sorry, buddy, I think I'm gonna need it.

1377
01:22:46.338 --> 01:22:47.505
Shit.

1378
01:22:48.673 --> 01:22:49.913
What's the situation out there?

1379
01:22:49.966 --> 01:22:53.011
Grab a gun, meet me on the roof.
I'll tell you all about it.

1380
01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:55.013
He isn't serious, is he?

1381
01:22:55.096 --> 01:22:56.890
'Cause that's his job, that's not my job.

1382
01:22:57.307 --> 01:22:58.475
He is serious.

1383
01:22:58.558 --> 01:23:00.560
Come on up! Check it out!

1384
01:23:15.367 --> 01:23:16.701
Listen up, guys!

1385
01:23:18.411 --> 01:23:21.039
I'm gonna take Building C.
Jack, Tig, I want you on Building D.

1386
01:23:22.165 --> 01:23:25.585
Building A, Tanto, Boon.
Building B, DS guys, that's your territory.

1387
01:23:25.919 --> 01:23:27.462
Oz, Tower 1. Zombieland.

1388
01:23:28.213 --> 01:23:29.756
Let's go. Hit it.

1389
01:23:31.257 --> 01:23:32.425
Move!

1390
01:23:32.550 --> 01:23:34.230
Let's go! Let's go! Let's hustle up!

1391
01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:47.440
Rone, I got the tower!
Getting up on C!

1392
01:24:11.715 --> 01:24:13.174
They're just the local shepherds.

1393
01:25:09.355 --> 01:25:11.149
Hey, what's going on?

1394
01:25:11.316 --> 01:25:13.693
We got a neighbor at the gate
complaining about our lights.

1395
01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:15.660
What, does he think
we're having a pool party?

1396
01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:17.989
He says the lights are bad.
They're going to find you.

1397
01:25:18.364 --> 01:25:19.449
"They"?

1398
01:25:19.532 --> 01:25:21.910
How the fuck does he know
who "they" are? Ask him.

1399
01:25:23.995 --> 01:25:25.205
He's already gone.

1400
01:25:26.122 --> 01:25:29.793
<i>Guys, we really
need to do something about these lights.</i>

1401
01:25:30.126 --> 01:25:31.920
We've got to shut all these lights down.

1402
01:25:32.962 --> 01:25:35.715
<i>Hey, guys,
keep your IRS pointed up for the gunship</i>

1403
01:25:36.382 --> 01:25:38.384
<i>that's hopefully fucking coming.</i>

1404
01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:40.970
Time for stealth has passed.

1405
01:25:41.054 --> 01:25:43.097
Viper, keep the perimeter floodlights on.

1406
01:25:43.473 --> 01:25:44.849
Shut off the interiors.

1407
01:25:44.933 --> 01:25:47.352
Roger that. Roger that.
Come on, come on.

1408
01:25:47.894 --> 01:25:51.397
In Iraq, we had Black Hawks
to get us out of shit like this.

1409
01:25:51.689 --> 01:25:54.567
Yeah. Well, here we got
nothing and no one.

1410
01:25:54.818 --> 01:25:56.277
Kill the interior lights!

1411
01:25:56.569 --> 01:25:58.729
<i>- We're lit fucking targets up here.</i>
- I'm trying, man.

1412
01:26:01.991 --> 01:26:03.076
Hello.

1413
01:26:05.078 --> 01:26:06.788
Surreal.

1414
01:26:06.871 --> 01:26:08.289
Different world.

1415
01:26:16.005 --> 01:26:17.090
Who's this?

1416
01:26:18.007 --> 01:26:21.427
Amahl, are those cars coming
from the neighbor's house?

1417
01:26:23.596 --> 01:26:26.099
Hey! Where the fuck are they going?

1418
01:26:29.519 --> 01:26:33.022
Guys, we just lost all our Libyan security.

1419
01:26:33.106 --> 01:26:34.357
Does it seem

1420
01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:36.359
like everybody knows what's going
on around here but us?

1421
01:26:36.526 --> 01:26:37.527
That's for sure.

1422
01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:40.572
Strobe's on, marking our position
for the Predator.

1423
01:26:40.655 --> 01:26:41.990
I hate to break it to you,

1424
01:26:42.073 --> 01:26:44.242
but I don't think
we're getting any gunships.

1425
01:26:44.617 --> 01:26:48.621
Oh. Hell no. Air support?
That'd be too easy.

1426
01:26:49.706 --> 01:26:51.708
<i>Viper, turn off
these goddamn interiors</i>

1427
01:26:51.791 --> 01:26:53.042
or I'm gonna shoot them out myself!

1428
01:26:53.126 --> 01:26:54.127
I'm working on it.

1429
01:26:54.294 --> 01:26:55.503
- He's having a bad night.
<i>- Work with me.</i>

1430
01:26:55.587 --> 01:26:56.796
- Fuck.
<i>- Come on.</i>

1431
01:26:57.797 --> 01:26:59.299
Oh!

1432
01:27:00.133 --> 01:27:02.135
Sorry, guys. I'm just a bit nervous.

1433
01:27:02.552 --> 01:27:04.721
Wow. Thank you.

1434
01:27:05.471 --> 01:27:07.599
Rone, which way
you think they're coming?

1435
01:27:07.765 --> 01:27:10.810
When they come,
they're coming through Zombieland.

1436
01:27:16.566 --> 01:27:20.153
That's strange. That cop slowed down,
then sped back up.

1437
01:27:20.403 --> 01:27:22.739
<i>I feel like I'm in
a fucking horror movie.</i>

1438
01:27:26.826 --> 01:27:27.911
- Chef?
- Yeah?

1439
01:27:27.994 --> 01:27:29.412
Put that down right there.

1440
01:27:29.495 --> 01:27:31.915
You go downstairs, make sure
everybody in this building's safe.

1441
01:27:31.998 --> 01:27:32.999
Got it.

1442
01:27:34.751 --> 01:27:37.670
Oz? This is where
we make our stand!

1443
01:27:39.672 --> 01:27:41.507
- It's dark out there.
- Hey, Rone,

1444
01:27:41.674 --> 01:27:44.510
we're going to Building B.
It's better vantage.

1445
01:27:44.677 --> 01:27:46.095
Get those DS guys off of there.

1446
01:27:46.179 --> 01:27:47.347
State!

1447
01:27:47.972 --> 01:27:50.767
I want you to go down
and protect Building C from the ground.

1448
01:28:04.113 --> 01:28:07.867
Guys, let's set sectors of fire
with overlapping coverage.

1449
01:28:07.951 --> 01:28:10.536
Tig, I can use you over here on Tower 3.

1450
01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:12.205
Oz, what do you got?

1451
01:28:14.707 --> 01:28:16.709
I got a couple
of local shepherds walking.

1452
01:28:17.293 --> 01:28:20.380
Hey, State, we got this.
Lot of acreage out there.

1453
01:28:20.713 --> 01:28:22.715
- Get on your NODs.
- Copy that.

1454
01:28:24.717 --> 01:28:27.971
Hey, Chief. Are we expecting any
friendlies to set up a perimeter?

1455
01:28:28.054 --> 01:28:30.473
<i>Uh... Not that I know of. Why?</i>

1456
01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:32.475
'Cause we got cars
amassing, east side.

1457
01:28:32.642 --> 01:28:34.082
In the parking lot out by that house

1458
01:28:34.143 --> 01:28:36.145
where the teenagers
are that throw the M-80s over the yard.

1459
01:28:36.229 --> 01:28:38.439
<i>Then I guess it could be poker night.</i>

1460
01:28:39.023 --> 01:28:40.191
Just hold on.

1461
01:28:40.566 --> 01:28:43.069
Hey. I got two cop cars pulling in.

1462
01:28:43.236 --> 01:28:46.572
Chief, are we expecting
any of Benghazi's finest anytime soon?

1463
01:28:46.739 --> 01:28:47.907
<i>Let me check on it. Hold on.</i>

1464
01:28:47.991 --> 01:28:48.992
Yeah. Take your time.

1465
01:28:49.659 --> 01:28:51.077
Alan, check the perimeter.

1466
01:28:51.202 --> 01:28:52.922
Call Benghazi police
and see if that's them.

1467
01:28:53.746 --> 01:28:57.500
<i>Chief, these cops?
I bet you they work for the bad guys.</i>

1468
01:28:58.167 --> 01:29:00.503
Does this look like 17 Feb to you?

1469
01:29:00.670 --> 01:29:02.422
Dude, how can you fucking tell?

1470
01:29:02.714 --> 01:29:04.882
They're all bad guys until they're not.

1471
01:29:09.095 --> 01:29:11.180
And there go the cop cars.

1472
01:29:11.514 --> 01:29:13.182
I got movement. You see this, guys?

1473
01:29:13.266 --> 01:29:14.267
Yeah, I see it.

1474
01:29:14.350 --> 01:29:15.685
<i>Boon, how many you see?</i>

1475
01:29:15.852 --> 01:29:17.687
I got unknowns moving to the parking lot.

1476
01:29:17.770 --> 01:29:18.771
15 Tangos.

1477
01:29:18.855 --> 01:29:20.106
I gotta call you back.

1478
01:29:20.231 --> 01:29:21.551
<i>Good vantage point from here.</i>

1479
01:29:23.276 --> 01:29:24.360
<i>Oz?</i>

1480
01:29:24.444 --> 01:29:28.614
All right. I got 5 more guys
right behind them little shepherds.

1481
01:29:28.781 --> 01:29:31.784
One of them's got something slung.
I can't see what it is.

1482
01:29:31.951 --> 01:29:33.369
<i>Everyone's got
weapons in Benghazi.</i>

1483
01:29:33.453 --> 01:29:35.121
Until you see a weapon
in someone's hands,

1484
01:29:35.246 --> 01:29:36.456
you do not fire.

1485
01:29:36.622 --> 01:29:37.957
I don't want anybody going to prison.

1486
01:29:38.082 --> 01:29:39.417
Roger that.

1487
01:29:41.294 --> 01:29:44.130
<i>Okay, they're breaking off.
It's game time.</i>

1488
01:29:44.964 --> 01:29:46.466
Guys, they are coming in.

1489
01:29:46.549 --> 01:29:49.510
Oh, yeah, they're coming in now.
Come on.

1490
01:29:59.937 --> 01:30:01.981
Chief, if we're expecting any friendlies,

1491
01:30:02.106 --> 01:30:04.150
I need to know that information now.

1492
01:30:04.984 --> 01:30:08.154
I am not aware of any friendlies.
I have no confirmation.

1493
01:30:12.825 --> 01:30:15.745
<i>AFRICOM,
ISR is approaching target coordinates</i>

1494
01:30:15.828 --> 01:30:17.538
<i>from deployed strobe tracker.</i>

1495
01:30:17.622 --> 01:30:19.499
<i>Await further instruction.</i>

1496
01:30:19.832 --> 01:30:22.168
<i>ISR, eyes-on report.</i>

1497
01:30:22.502 --> 01:30:24.342
<i>AFRICOM, unknowns are advancing</i>

1498
01:30:24.378 --> 01:30:26.172
<i>toward subject compound</i>

1499
01:30:26.297 --> 01:30:29.092
<i>moving from south/southeast
over open ground.</i>

1500
01:30:29.175 --> 01:30:31.594
<i>No tags or colors.
Asymmetrical movements.</i>

1501
01:30:31.677 --> 01:30:33.513
<i>No weapons observed.</i>

1502
01:30:33.846 --> 01:30:35.848
Cyclops pushing in at 140.

1503
01:30:36.849 --> 01:30:39.018
State, we're being surrounded
by Tangos right now.

1504
01:30:39.102 --> 01:30:42.188
Chief, this shit's starting to get real.

1505
01:30:43.439 --> 01:30:45.733
<i>Oz, we got 7 Tangos by the pillars.</i>

1506
01:30:47.610 --> 01:30:48.694
Got 'em.

1507
01:30:51.447 --> 01:30:53.032
<i>Let 'em come.</i>

1508
01:30:55.201 --> 01:30:56.869
Let 'em come.

1509
01:31:02.291 --> 01:31:03.793
<i>Let 'em come.</i>

1510
01:31:13.803 --> 01:31:16.556
<i>Chief, are we
cleared hot to shoot?</i>

1511
01:31:17.807 --> 01:31:20.351
Chief, I repeat,
are we cleared hot to shoot?

1512
01:31:22.895 --> 01:31:25.231
See a weapon, shooter's discretion.

1513
01:31:25.398 --> 01:31:28.734
Everybody hold. You do not
fucking fire till I give the word.

1514
01:31:28.901 --> 01:31:30.403
I ain't shooting no kids, Boon.

1515
01:31:30.820 --> 01:31:32.572
All right, guys, eyes open.

1516
01:31:32.738 --> 01:31:35.698
I'm gonna paint these guys with the
infrared so we're all on the same page.

1517
01:31:36.159 --> 01:31:37.660
Everybody got this guy?

1518
01:31:37.827 --> 01:31:39.412
Roger.
Yeah. I got him.

1519
01:31:39.662 --> 01:31:40.746
This guy?

1520
01:31:40.830 --> 01:31:42.331
- <i>Got him.</i>
- Got him.

1521
01:31:42.915 --> 01:31:43.916
<i>This guy?</i>

1522
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.418
- Got him.
- <i>Got him.</i>

1523
01:31:45.501 --> 01:31:47.003
- How about that guy?
- Three.

1524
01:31:47.170 --> 01:31:48.171
<i>I see him.</i>

1525
01:31:48.337 --> 01:31:51.757
Look at these guys.
It's like kids playing hide and seek.

1526
01:31:52.258 --> 01:31:53.509
I got AKs.

1527
01:31:53.885 --> 01:31:55.553
<i>You guys got to draw them in.</i>

1528
01:31:55.761 --> 01:31:57.513
Draw them in. They cannot see you.

1529
01:31:57.638 --> 01:31:59.432
We have night vision, they don't.

1530
01:31:59.682 --> 01:32:00.933
Turn the lights off now.

1531
01:32:01.100 --> 01:32:02.268
<i>How much closer
do we let them get?</i>

1532
01:32:02.393 --> 01:32:03.603
<i>They got weapons.</i>

1533
01:32:04.770 --> 01:32:06.439
Come on, Rone, they're right here.

1534
01:32:06.772 --> 01:32:09.192
<i>We got about 25-30 Tangos.</i>

1535
01:32:56.155 --> 01:32:57.823
I'm taking the right side.

1536
01:33:38.781 --> 01:33:40.199
Tig, you hit?

1537
01:33:40.700 --> 01:33:41.740
You all right?

1538
01:33:41.867 --> 01:33:42.868
Armor caught it.

1539
01:33:54.797 --> 01:33:55.881
That's a mistake.

1540
01:34:03.889 --> 01:34:05.349
Dude, we kicked their asses!

1541
01:34:06.559 --> 01:34:08.728
I don't know if I'm feeling
lucky or unlucky.

1542
01:34:09.061 --> 01:34:11.501
They thought they were walking
into another temporary embassy.

1543
01:34:12.565 --> 01:34:14.191
Not here, brother.

1544
01:34:14.483 --> 01:34:17.570
<i>Chief, get us some air support,
huh? Get us fucking something!</i>

1545
01:34:17.903 --> 01:34:19.739
GRS, check in.

1546
01:34:19.864 --> 01:34:21.824
<i>All good, Boon,
Tanto, Building B.</i>

1547
01:34:22.199 --> 01:34:23.868
D was out of the fight.

1548
01:34:24.035 --> 01:34:26.704
Tower 3,
Tig and Oz, never better.

1549
01:34:27.038 --> 01:34:28.748
Let's get you up. Stay down.

1550
01:34:32.418 --> 01:34:34.920
Bad guy's house
is still active, Ty.

1551
01:34:35.588 --> 01:34:36.630
We got eyes on.

1552
01:34:36.756 --> 01:34:37.840
Roger that.

1553
01:34:38.215 --> 01:34:39.925
They shot out all the lights.

1554
01:34:40.092 --> 01:34:41.886
First wave got the job done.

1555
01:34:43.554 --> 01:34:46.098
You want a coffee? I sure as hell do.

1556
01:34:46.849 --> 01:34:49.352
<i>I guess the drone saw
30 guys shooting at us.</i>

1557
01:34:49.435 --> 01:34:50.478
Come on.

1558
01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:56.442
<i>Secure
with tech two encryption.</i>

1559
01:34:58.069 --> 01:35:00.780
Why is this shepherd walking
around after a gunfight?

1560
01:35:01.947 --> 01:35:03.282
So bizarre.

1561
01:35:03.449 --> 01:35:05.117
These sheep freak me out.

1562
01:35:05.451 --> 01:35:07.203
Somebody could take
a potshot from in there.

1563
01:35:07.286 --> 01:35:08.454
I don't think it's safe.

1564
01:35:09.121 --> 01:35:10.289
Let's get out of here.

1565
01:35:14.126 --> 01:35:17.922
Dave, you got to slow it down, buddy.
You're working too hard.

1566
01:35:20.216 --> 01:35:23.719
Look, this isn't a choice for me.

1567
01:35:24.387 --> 01:35:25.888
We lost the Ambassador.

1568
01:35:26.472 --> 01:35:29.225
That's on our heads, not yours.

1569
01:35:29.308 --> 01:35:31.811
And, look, I get it.
I know what you're thinking.

1570
01:35:32.728 --> 01:35:34.897
But if Scott had fired
on that mob from the safe haven,

1571
01:35:34.980 --> 01:35:36.420
it would've given away his position.

1572
01:35:36.482 --> 01:35:37.942
And we wouldn't have had
a fighting chance in hell

1573
01:35:38.025 --> 01:35:39.110
to get him out.

1574
01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:46.450
So, I'm in this fight. All night.

1575
01:35:47.993 --> 01:35:49.495
I know you are.

1576
01:35:52.123 --> 01:35:53.791
I get it, man.

1577
01:36:05.052 --> 01:36:07.721
Hey! Hey, what's going on?
Where are our rides?

1578
01:36:07.888 --> 01:36:10.008
Look, this is all
screwed-up Libyan bureaucracy. Okay.

1579
01:36:10.349 --> 01:36:12.476
Who drives, who goes first,
and of course who gets paid the most.

1580
01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:15.563
We don't have time for this!
You tell them to figure it out.

1581
01:36:17.022 --> 01:36:18.399
Keep a close watch on them.

1582
01:36:18.524 --> 01:36:20.044
We don't know who's good
and who's bad.

1583
01:36:20.192 --> 01:36:21.193
Copy that.

1584
01:36:24.655 --> 01:36:27.283
We're wheels down,
but we got a problem.

1585
01:36:30.536 --> 01:36:32.079
What do you got? Coffee.

1586
01:36:33.289 --> 01:36:34.457
- Amahl.
- Yes.

1587
01:36:34.540 --> 01:36:36.917
Tell him he should assemble his men
as quickly as possible

1588
01:36:37.001 --> 01:36:38.544
and that we will pay him.

1589
01:36:41.589 --> 01:36:42.965
- Cash.
- Cash? Fine.

1590
01:36:43.048 --> 01:36:44.258
When? When can they be here?

1591
01:36:44.425 --> 01:36:45.718
Where's the Chief?

1592
01:36:46.051 --> 01:36:48.471
Just bring... That he brings his fucking
men as soon as possible

1593
01:36:48.554 --> 01:36:50.222
and get us the hell out of here.

1594
01:36:53.350 --> 01:36:54.852
Looting the compound.

1595
01:36:55.895 --> 01:36:58.772
Blood in the water. Sharks are circling.

1596
01:36:59.732 --> 01:37:01.567
The Tripoli team is stuck at the airport.

1597
01:37:02.276 --> 01:37:05.112
They need an escort.
They don't know the city.

1598
01:37:09.909 --> 01:37:11.827
No love from the Libyan government?

1599
01:37:11.911 --> 01:37:13.787
They've gone home for the night.

1600
01:37:14.246 --> 01:37:15.831
Or just not answering.

1601
01:37:17.208 --> 01:37:18.709
What about ours?

1602
01:37:19.919 --> 01:37:21.587
They picking up the phone?

1603
01:37:22.588 --> 01:37:23.964
I'm working on it.

1604
01:37:24.089 --> 01:37:25.424
That drone feed's up.

1605
01:37:26.217 --> 01:37:28.260
They're seeing everything
we see and more.

1606
01:37:36.435 --> 01:37:39.522
<i>We've identified
the forces that can move to Benghazi.</i>

1607
01:37:39.605 --> 01:37:41.815
<i>They're spinning up as we speak.</i>

1608
01:37:41.899 --> 01:37:43.150
<i>State has been asked</i>

1609
01:37:43.275 --> 01:37:44.318
<i>to secure the approval
from the host nation.</i>

1610
01:37:44.401 --> 01:37:46.487
<i>General, this could be a hostile airport,</i>

1611
01:37:46.737 --> 01:37:49.031
<i>so we are considering every option.</i>

1612
01:37:49.114 --> 01:37:50.991
<i>Understood. It's a fluid situation.</i>

1613
01:37:51.116 --> 01:37:53.077
<i>But there are a lot
of Americans stuck there.</i>

1614
01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:55.441
<i>I say we get them airborne,
then we can make our decision.</i>

1615
01:37:55.496 --> 01:37:58.541
Hey, Glen, we've been
waiting for 3 hours.

1616
01:37:58.624 --> 01:38:00.209
Can we just commandeer
these vehicles and go?

1617
01:38:00.292 --> 01:38:03.295
Getting in isn't the problem.
Getting out again is.

1618
01:38:05.756 --> 01:38:07.341
Hey!

1619
01:38:07.424 --> 01:38:08.592
Can you explain to them

1620
01:38:08.676 --> 01:38:10.761
that if this bullshit
ends up costing American lives,

1621
01:38:10.844 --> 01:38:13.125
I'm gonna come back
here and cut all their throats myself,

1622
01:38:13.347 --> 01:38:14.557
starting with him.

1623
01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:15.724
You tell him that.

1624
01:38:17.309 --> 01:38:19.144
What a shitshow.

1625
01:38:20.688 --> 01:38:22.565
State got a report
from the Benghazi Medical Center

1626
01:38:22.648 --> 01:38:26.026
that said a crowd
of Libyans brought in an American male

1627
01:38:26.527 --> 01:38:27.695
alive.

1628
01:38:28.571 --> 01:38:31.171
They used Scott Wickland's phone,
said it came from Chris' pocket.

1629
01:38:34.034 --> 01:38:35.869
Could try and draw us in.

1630
01:38:36.704 --> 01:38:38.122
Watch out for an ambush.

1631
01:38:40.624 --> 01:38:41.834
What do you see?

1632
01:38:43.544 --> 01:38:45.004
I'm not sure what it is.

1633
01:38:45.629 --> 01:38:48.507
Either the bad guys
are crawling under the sheep

1634
01:38:49.466 --> 01:38:52.469
or the sheep are humping.

1635
01:38:53.178 --> 01:38:54.680
2:30 at night?

1636
01:38:57.016 --> 01:38:58.976
I don't know anything about sheep.

1637
01:39:08.694 --> 01:39:10.195
Watch your step.

1638
01:39:13.991 --> 01:39:14.992
Oz.

1639
01:39:15.534 --> 01:39:17.411
Stay low. Stay low.

1640
01:39:19.830 --> 01:39:21.707
I brought you candy bars
and some drinks.

1641
01:39:28.589 --> 01:39:29.882
Your head.

1642
01:39:30.382 --> 01:39:31.717
It's nothing.

1643
01:39:32.593 --> 01:39:34.261
You need anything else?

1644
01:39:34.553 --> 01:39:35.554
Well,

1645
01:39:36.388 --> 01:39:38.223
a lawn chair wouldn't be bad.

1646
01:39:38.891 --> 01:39:40.225
Right. No problem.

1647
01:39:40.517 --> 01:39:42.394
And a gunship.

1648
01:39:44.563 --> 01:39:46.899
I don't think we're gonna
be able to get you that.

1649
01:39:47.232 --> 01:39:49.401
I'd settle for a few F16s.

1650
01:39:50.736 --> 01:39:52.321
Low fly-by over the city would

1651
01:39:52.404 --> 01:39:55.240
put the fear of God
and the United States in them.

1652
01:39:57.117 --> 01:39:58.911
Buy us a few more hours.

1653
01:40:06.627 --> 01:40:08.629
How long can you hold them off?

1654
01:40:11.090 --> 01:40:14.259
Any large force with any real ordnance,
I don't know.

1655
01:40:16.929 --> 01:40:18.931
You got contacts here and at home?

1656
01:40:20.599 --> 01:40:22.726
Start making some calls.

1657
01:40:24.269 --> 01:40:26.029
Hey, the stripper's here!

1658
01:40:26.105 --> 01:40:28.107
- Here are your clothes.
- About time.

1659
01:40:28.399 --> 01:40:30.442
How are the Jason Bournes
doing downstairs?

1660
01:40:30.776 --> 01:40:32.069
Everyone's scared.

1661
01:40:32.569 --> 01:40:35.406
I just got a text from my cousin,
you know, a warning,

1662
01:40:35.572 --> 01:40:37.324
saying to leave before it's too late.

1663
01:40:38.117 --> 01:40:39.159
More good news.

1664
01:40:39.284 --> 01:40:40.604
Anything more specific than that?

1665
01:40:42.746 --> 01:40:45.290
I don't think we need
an interpreter anymore, Amahl.

1666
01:40:45.624 --> 01:40:47.459
You did good. You should go.

1667
01:40:49.878 --> 01:40:53.632
No. I'm staying here with you guys.

1668
01:40:56.135 --> 01:40:57.344
I'll be downstairs.

1669
01:41:02.141 --> 01:41:04.476
I'm gonna have to break up
with him before we leave Libya.

1670
01:41:06.979 --> 01:41:09.523
How do you leave me
on D when the party's right here?

1671
01:41:11.483 --> 01:41:13.610
Hey, about this whole Ambo story,

1672
01:41:14.445 --> 01:41:15.821
I don't buy it.

1673
01:41:15.988 --> 01:41:19.700
And if he is still alive,
Glen's team's gonna get him out first.

1674
01:41:19.783 --> 01:41:21.660
If they do, they're not gonna get to us.

1675
01:41:21.785 --> 01:41:23.785
So we've got to be prepared
to be here for a while.

1676
01:41:25.497 --> 01:41:27.624
Chief said it was
on the news back home.

1677
01:41:27.708 --> 01:41:30.919
Something about street protests.
Anti-Islamic films.

1678
01:41:31.545 --> 01:41:33.213
We didn't hear any protests.

1679
01:41:33.505 --> 01:41:34.965
It was reported in the news, buddy.

1680
01:41:35.048 --> 01:41:36.488
Hey.

1681
01:41:37.384 --> 01:41:38.677
You see that?

1682
01:41:40.888 --> 01:41:43.223
At the end of Smuggler's Alley.
Take a look.

1683
01:41:53.317 --> 01:41:54.693
Could be a second front forming.

1684
01:41:55.402 --> 01:41:56.779
Or an audience gathering
to watch the show.

1685
01:41:56.862 --> 01:41:57.905
<i>Hey, Chief.</i>

1686
01:41:58.155 --> 01:41:59.907
I know you've had some
pearls of wisdom tonight,

1687
01:42:00.032 --> 01:42:01.700
but are we expecting any friendlies?

1688
01:42:01.909 --> 01:42:03.410
I got a lot of movement out here.

1689
01:42:03.702 --> 01:42:05.182
Looks like we're gonna get hit again.

1690
01:42:09.917 --> 01:42:12.211
Dave, take Zombieland. Oz, with me.

1691
01:42:15.255 --> 01:42:17.090
Grab a shield. Grab a shield.

1692
01:42:27.017 --> 01:42:29.561
<i>Chief, tell them
to get the Hellfire on that Pred ready.</i>

1693
01:42:42.241 --> 01:42:43.700
Be advised,

1694
01:42:43.867 --> 01:42:46.495
ISR saying that
cars and bodies are massing

1695
01:42:46.578 --> 01:42:48.831
in the parking lot to our west.

1696
01:42:48.914 --> 01:42:51.583
Yeah, Chief, I just put that out
over the radio about two minutes ago.

1697
01:42:51.667 --> 01:42:54.169
Tell the ISR guys
they're pretty much worthless.

1698
01:42:55.212 --> 01:42:56.296
Fucking smartass.

1699
01:43:04.888 --> 01:43:06.265
Come on, come on, come on!

1700
01:43:06.557 --> 01:43:07.724
Send.

1701
01:43:20.946 --> 01:43:22.466
<i>Chief, we got 30 guys approaching.</i>

1702
01:43:24.992 --> 01:43:26.618
Hey. Is that thing loud?

1703
01:43:28.662 --> 01:43:29.788
Oh, yeah.

1704
01:43:30.664 --> 01:43:32.040
I forgot my earplugs.

1705
01:43:32.583 --> 01:43:34.543
<i>Keep your eyes
on your assigned quadrants.</i>

1706
01:43:34.626 --> 01:43:35.961
<i>We don't want to get flanked.</i>

1707
01:43:37.671 --> 01:43:39.006
You ready, Tig?

1708
01:43:39.673 --> 01:43:41.800
- Here we go.
- Watch for different tactics.

1709
01:43:49.141 --> 01:43:50.142
Oz?

1710
01:43:50.976 --> 01:43:52.102
You lose your tampon?

1711
01:43:56.231 --> 01:43:57.511
<i>Tig, watch the pine trees.</i>

1712
01:44:21.506 --> 01:44:22.841
<i>What is this?</i>

1713
01:44:23.342 --> 01:44:25.344
What is this yo-yo doing?

1714
01:44:25.510 --> 01:44:27.846
You think they don't know
we have night vision?

1715
01:44:29.181 --> 01:44:31.642
<i>GRS,
I want everybody to hold.</i>

1716
01:44:34.895 --> 01:44:36.521
<i>30 yards.</i>

1717
01:44:40.692 --> 01:44:42.402
No, no, no, no.
What are you doing?

1718
01:44:42.569 --> 01:44:43.695
No, don't do that. Fuck!

1719
01:44:52.704 --> 01:44:53.705
Get down!

1720
01:44:58.752 --> 01:45:00.587
What? Louder!

1721
01:45:02.589 --> 01:45:04.424
<i>Stop! Stop shooting!</i>

1722
01:45:04.591 --> 01:45:06.218
17 Feb says you're firing at them!

1723
01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:08.845
Somebody started shooting at us first!

1724
01:45:09.721 --> 01:45:11.598
And they're still fucking shooting at us!

1725
01:45:13.892 --> 01:45:15.435
Tell them to stop shooting at us

1726
01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:17.104
and we'll stop shooting at them.

1727
01:45:17.354 --> 01:45:20.190
If they're shooting at you,
just fucking shoot back!

1728
01:45:20.565 --> 01:45:23.735
That's what I'm telling you!
We got 30 guys firing at us!

1729
01:45:24.069 --> 01:45:25.570
17 Feb, my ass.

1730
01:45:31.118 --> 01:45:32.244
Tig, tree line.

1731
01:46:00.105 --> 01:46:01.857
They're flanking us
from Zombieland!

1732
01:46:01.940 --> 01:46:03.275
- Move!
- Moving!

1733
01:46:09.781 --> 01:46:10.782
Upstairs window.

1734
01:46:27.674 --> 01:46:28.675
Bus.

1735
01:46:29.176 --> 01:46:30.736
We got big ordnance
coming out of there.

1736
01:46:30.802 --> 01:46:31.803
Hit the bus!

1737
01:46:45.609 --> 01:46:46.985
That one's for us.

1738
01:46:53.450 --> 01:46:55.050
You're not getting away this time!

1739
01:47:03.835 --> 01:47:05.212
You think they're losing heart?

1740
01:47:05.670 --> 01:47:07.172
Everyone, over here.

1741
01:47:08.298 --> 01:47:10.967
Find me every airbase
in the area that can reach us.

1742
01:47:11.134 --> 01:47:12.260
Find me any
quick response teams,

1743
01:47:12.344 --> 01:47:14.384
any Navy carrier battle groups
in the vicinity, now.

1744
01:47:22.521 --> 01:47:24.523
I hear they have
a US CIF team in Croatia.

1745
01:47:24.648 --> 01:47:25.848
That's a 2-hour flight.

1746
01:47:26.358 --> 01:47:29.194
Sigonella, Aviano, Benghazi.

1747
01:47:29.361 --> 01:47:31.154
- How far is Aviano?
- 700 miles.

1748
01:47:31.321 --> 01:47:34.199
There's an F16, 365 days 24/7.
It's a quick response base.

1749
01:47:34.366 --> 01:47:35.742
Well, bring it in from Sigonella.

1750
01:47:35.867 --> 01:47:37.327
It's a fucking puddle jump
from Italy to here.

1751
01:47:37.410 --> 01:47:38.453
It's 20 minutes.

1752
01:47:40.539 --> 01:47:42.374
<i>I'm not requesting firepower.</i>

1753
01:47:42.582 --> 01:47:45.544
All I want is that you
give these assholes outside our gate

1754
01:47:46.044 --> 01:47:50.048
a low, loud "fuck you" flyover.

1755
01:47:51.049 --> 01:47:52.551
My authority?

1756
01:47:56.096 --> 01:47:57.430
My authority

1757
01:47:57.848 --> 01:48:01.268
is that if you don't send,
Americans are going to die.

1758
01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:04.062
Including the one
talking to you right now.

1759
01:48:14.906 --> 01:48:17.951
You see that, dude?
There's guys on those rocks over there.

1760
01:48:19.494 --> 01:48:20.620
There's nothing there.

1761
01:48:22.873 --> 01:48:25.876
Your eyes are playing tricks, man.
Why don't you go take a break?

1762
01:48:26.918 --> 01:48:29.004
No. I'm okay.

1763
01:48:29.087 --> 01:48:31.256
Tig, take a break.

1764
01:48:38.430 --> 01:48:41.892
Hey, Tig.
Go on down, man. I'll spell you.

1765
01:48:44.227 --> 01:48:46.104
Oh, those State guys.

1766
01:48:46.438 --> 01:48:50.442
Dave up on C,
you should see the look in his eyes.

1767
01:48:52.444 --> 01:48:55.572
These guys are gonna relive this
night for the rest of their lives.

1768
01:48:56.740 --> 01:48:59.910
My whole mindset? Never feel that.

1769
01:49:00.285 --> 01:49:02.662
You go down shooting,
balls out, every time.

1770
01:49:05.332 --> 01:49:06.833
How you doing, brother?

1771
01:49:07.834 --> 01:49:10.337
Down time's the worst, isn't it?

1772
01:49:11.796 --> 01:49:14.758
Adrenaline leaves
and your mind just starts to wander.

1773
01:49:14.841 --> 01:49:15.842
Oh, yeah.

1774
01:49:18.178 --> 01:49:20.680
I haven't thought
about my family once tonight.

1775
01:49:24.476 --> 01:49:25.936
Thinking about them now.

1776
01:49:27.187 --> 01:49:29.356
Up here in the middle of all this,

1777
01:49:33.026 --> 01:49:35.028
I'm thinking about my girls, man.

1778
01:49:36.363 --> 01:49:37.656
Thinking

1779
01:49:38.990 --> 01:49:40.867
what would they say about me?

1780
01:49:43.119 --> 01:49:45.121
"He died in a place he didn't need to be,"

1781
01:49:46.665 --> 01:49:50.001
"in a battle over something
he doesn't understand,"

1782
01:49:52.337 --> 01:49:54.673
"in a country that meant nothing to him."

1783
01:49:58.843 --> 01:50:02.180
Every time I go home to Becky
and those girls, I think this is it.

1784
01:50:03.139 --> 01:50:04.641
I'm gonna stay.

1785
01:50:06.184 --> 01:50:09.020
And then something happens
and I end up back here.

1786
01:50:09.980 --> 01:50:13.316
Why is that? Why can't I go home?

1787
01:50:14.359 --> 01:50:16.695
Why can't I go home and just stay there?

1788
01:50:18.697 --> 01:50:21.032
Warriors aren't trained to retire, Jack.

1789
01:50:23.034 --> 01:50:24.202
Becky's pregnant.

1790
01:50:24.703 --> 01:50:25.870
You kidding me?

1791
01:50:27.539 --> 01:50:29.040
She told me today.

1792
01:50:32.085 --> 01:50:34.254
And that can't be the last call.

1793
01:50:34.587 --> 01:50:36.756
That can't be the last call,
'cause I'm sitting up here

1794
01:50:36.923 --> 01:50:39.204
and I'm thinking about some
other guy raising these girls.

1795
01:50:42.887 --> 01:50:43.888
Man, I'm sorry.

1796
01:50:44.222 --> 01:50:45.702
- No, no, hey...
- I shouldn't have...

1797
01:50:45.765 --> 01:50:48.727
Mmm-mmm. No, man, no... It's all right.

1798
01:50:49.436 --> 01:50:51.604
I get it. Okay?

1799
01:50:52.272 --> 01:50:53.773
You go to them.

1800
01:50:54.566 --> 01:50:57.068
I know what it's like to be
in a place like this,

1801
01:50:57.944 --> 01:51:00.280
let another man raise your children.

1802
01:51:01.406 --> 01:51:04.451
When I was young,
I was giving myself to something bigger.

1803
01:51:06.578 --> 01:51:08.288
Jack, that something bigger's gone now.

1804
01:51:14.419 --> 01:51:15.920
But your new son?

1805
01:51:17.756 --> 01:51:19.215
Kai is your second chance.

1806
01:51:19.758 --> 01:51:21.676
I might actually not be a half-bad father.

1807
01:51:26.222 --> 01:51:29.726
"All the gods, all the heavens,
all the hells are within you."

1808
01:51:31.102 --> 01:51:32.270
What is that?

1809
01:51:34.606 --> 01:51:36.441
Something Boon dropped on me earlier.

1810
01:51:38.234 --> 01:51:41.071
And it's just been going around
in my head all night.

1811
01:51:42.280 --> 01:51:44.741
<i>We have some clarity
on a couple of issues.</i>

1812
01:51:45.075 --> 01:51:49.621
<i>The Tripoli team has cleared the airport,
and they are on their way.</i>

1813
01:51:51.414 --> 01:51:53.958
You've got to be kidding me.
It's about time.

1814
01:51:55.126 --> 01:51:57.128
<i>We also have confirmation.</i>

1815
01:51:58.129 --> 01:52:00.340
<i>It is Ambassador Stevens.</i>

1816
01:52:01.007 --> 01:52:04.302
<i>But the earlier report
that he was admitted alive</i>

1817
01:52:04.427 --> 01:52:05.845
<i>was inaccurate.</i>

1818
01:52:07.180 --> 01:52:09.682
<i>He was apparently found
in the back of the villa</i>

1819
01:52:10.016 --> 01:52:12.519
<i>and brought to the hospital
by a crowd of Libyans.</i>

1820
01:52:13.019 --> 01:52:15.021
<i>Cause of death is smoke inhalation.</i>

1821
01:52:15.480 --> 01:52:16.481
Shit.

1822
01:52:19.484 --> 01:52:21.277
You know, we could've saved him

1823
01:52:21.403 --> 01:52:23.196
if we'd gone when we got the call.

1824
01:52:23.822 --> 01:52:24.989
We could've saved them both.

1825
01:52:25.156 --> 01:52:26.366
Yep.

1826
01:52:29.536 --> 01:52:31.704
You know, they're gonna
get this figured out.

1827
01:52:31.830 --> 01:52:33.832
Come at us with technicals next.

1828
01:52:34.374 --> 01:52:36.876
We'll have to get down off this roof
and engage them direct.

1829
01:52:39.170 --> 01:52:40.505
Yeah, I know.

1830
01:52:49.013 --> 01:52:51.015
I never really get scared.

1831
01:52:51.850 --> 01:52:53.184
Is that weird?

1832
01:52:54.519 --> 01:52:57.397
Whenever bullets start to fly,
I always feel protected.

1833
01:52:57.856 --> 01:52:59.023
You know, like it's...

1834
01:52:59.232 --> 01:53:03.236
As long as I'm doing the right thing,
God'll take care of me.

1835
01:53:04.904 --> 01:53:06.573
But that's crazy, right?

1836
01:53:07.866 --> 01:53:10.243
Not any more than
everything else you say.

1837
01:53:12.370 --> 01:53:13.663
Hope God has a sense of humor.

1838
01:53:13.746 --> 01:53:14.998
Yeah.

1839
01:53:15.081 --> 01:53:17.250
I guess we'll find out soon enough.

1840
01:53:19.169 --> 01:53:21.212
I had a good call home today.

1841
01:53:21.546 --> 01:53:22.547
Yeah?

1842
01:53:22.714 --> 01:53:24.215
Talked to my kids.

1843
01:53:24.716 --> 01:53:25.717
Me, too.

1844
01:53:25.884 --> 01:53:28.178
<i>Hey, we need somebody on
Building A eyeballing our visitors.</i>

1845
01:53:28.261 --> 01:53:30.472
Yep. That's me.

1846
01:53:31.556 --> 01:53:32.682
You good, brother?

1847
01:53:32.807 --> 01:53:33.892
Yep.

1848
01:53:35.059 --> 01:53:36.060
Hey, man.

1849
01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:39.189
It's been fun, right?

1850
01:53:40.398 --> 01:53:41.399
Yeah.

1851
01:53:44.861 --> 01:53:46.529
It's been fun.

1852
01:53:54.037 --> 01:53:56.122
What, do you mean
they don't know where it is?

1853
01:53:56.539 --> 01:53:59.125
Our Libyan friends here
aren't much help.

1854
01:53:59.709 --> 01:54:01.961
Okay, annex, we're officially lost.

1855
01:54:02.128 --> 01:54:05.215
Neither Google or Siri know
where the fuck you are.

1856
01:54:06.049 --> 01:54:09.552
Let Tripoli ops know
I'm lassoing our location.

1857
01:54:10.470 --> 01:54:13.389
There should be an IR lasso
visible right now.

1858
01:54:13.515 --> 01:54:16.351
There. There it is up ahead. I see it.

1859
01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:20.063
Man, I could crush some pancakes.

1860
01:54:20.813 --> 01:54:23.566
Smothered with butter.
Some of that whipped cream.

1861
01:54:24.234 --> 01:54:26.486
<i>Chocolate chips.
I'd do any of it right now.</i>

1862
01:54:26.819 --> 01:54:27.904
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

1863
01:54:28.154 --> 01:54:29.572
I don't know if this is
an awkward time to tell you,

1864
01:54:29.656 --> 01:54:32.283
but I've had to take a crap
ever since we left the consulate.

1865
01:54:32.909 --> 01:54:35.453
Way too much information, brother.

1866
01:54:38.373 --> 01:54:39.415
Hey, Chief.

1867
01:54:39.666 --> 01:54:41.834
We're expecting
more than one car, correct?

1868
01:54:42.168 --> 01:54:45.004
<i>I am not aware
of any friendlies. No word.</i>

1869
01:54:45.338 --> 01:54:47.465
I got three Tangos in a car coming up
to the front gate, right now.

1870
01:54:47.715 --> 01:54:48.758
Coming in hot.

1871
01:54:50.969 --> 01:54:52.303
They stopped.

1872
01:54:52.428 --> 01:54:53.429
Come on.

1873
01:54:53.513 --> 01:54:55.139
<i>He better have a weapon.</i>

1874
01:54:55.223 --> 01:54:56.224
Show me a gun.

1875
01:54:56.307 --> 01:54:57.475
<i>Could be a car bomb.</i>

1876
01:54:58.434 --> 01:55:01.145
Nope. No gun, just a phone.

1877
01:55:02.855 --> 01:55:04.691
I want to shoot this guy, Rone.

1878
01:55:04.816 --> 01:55:06.693
Rone, I'm gonna shoot him in the face.

1879
01:55:08.194 --> 01:55:11.030
What's he doing? He's turning around.

1880
01:55:12.782 --> 01:55:14.117
He's pulling out.

1881
01:55:15.451 --> 01:55:16.786
He's taking off.

1882
01:55:19.205 --> 01:55:20.415
Could be someone using their cell phone

1883
01:55:20.498 --> 01:55:21.582
to get target coordinates.

1884
01:55:30.550 --> 01:55:33.094
All right. Weird shit's
starting to happen now.

1885
01:55:33.469 --> 01:55:37.307
I've had just about enough of this
2012 Alamo bullshit.

1886
01:55:38.641 --> 01:55:40.727
Can we get the fuck out of here now?

1887
01:56:08.504 --> 01:56:10.923
I know I blew an eardrum earlier, but

1888
01:56:11.257 --> 01:56:12.967
did all the chanting just stop?

1889
01:56:14.010 --> 01:56:15.762
<i>That can't be good.</i>

1890
01:56:16.512 --> 01:56:19.057
<i>Guys, this sucks. Every Ranger knows</i>

1891
01:56:19.140 --> 01:56:21.642
<i>dawn is when the French
and Indians attack.</i>

1892
01:56:22.435 --> 01:56:24.937
I'm feeling lucky tonight, Tanto.

1893
01:56:29.984 --> 01:56:31.319
Chief.

1894
01:56:31.611 --> 01:56:34.364
Are we expecting some trucks,
or big mounted technicals?

1895
01:56:36.199 --> 01:56:38.743
Blue, blue! Cavalry's here!

1896
01:56:38.826 --> 01:56:41.506
Yeah. You're looking a little light,
but welcome to the party!

1897
01:56:41.996 --> 01:56:43.873
Middle East never lets you down.

1898
01:56:43.956 --> 01:56:46.751
Personable, organized, easy to navigate.

1899
01:56:47.085 --> 01:56:48.294
Makes me need a fucking drink!

1900
01:56:48.961 --> 01:56:50.004
Where's my frogman?

1901
01:56:50.129 --> 01:56:51.214
Building C, up top!

1902
01:56:51.547 --> 01:56:53.216
We gonna exfil now?

1903
01:56:53.299 --> 01:56:55.802
Get us to Tripoli,
brother, I'll get you wasted.

1904
01:56:58.304 --> 01:56:59.347
I'm the Commander of the Libyan Shield.

1905
01:56:59.430 --> 01:57:00.431
Thank you for coming.

1906
01:57:01.307 --> 01:57:03.434
Sir, we're tasked
with sensitive document destruction.

1907
01:57:03.976 --> 01:57:05.978
Not a moment too soon.
Hey, Glen!

1908
01:57:06.145 --> 01:57:07.939
Anyone call an airport limo?

1909
01:57:08.106 --> 01:57:09.440
What's up, brother Bub?

1910
01:57:09.774 --> 01:57:11.334
Good to see you, brother.

1911
01:57:11.526 --> 01:57:14.362
Sorry I'm late.
I got hung up in the gift shop.

1912
01:57:14.612 --> 01:57:16.197
Oh. You guys made a mess up here.

1913
01:57:16.364 --> 01:57:17.698
Would've waited for you,

1914
01:57:18.032 --> 01:57:20.410
but people crying and dying
over the radio, man.

1915
01:57:20.493 --> 01:57:21.536
We didn't have the heart for it.

1916
01:57:21.619 --> 01:57:24.372
Hey, Rone, I'd like to tell you
it's over, but it isn't.

1917
01:57:24.705 --> 01:57:26.499
The 24 CIA staffers here,

1918
01:57:26.582 --> 01:57:29.043
plus 5 State guys,
plus 6 GRS, plus us.

1919
01:57:29.127 --> 01:57:30.378
I get it. Too many.

1920
01:57:30.503 --> 01:57:31.796
There's no room in the jet.

1921
01:57:32.046 --> 01:57:34.215
You think you can hold things down
here for a few more hours?

1922
01:57:34.382 --> 01:57:35.758
I'll tell you what.

1923
01:57:36.592 --> 01:57:38.469
These are some hellish warriors.

1924
01:57:38.636 --> 01:57:40.805
I'd be lucky to have their back any day.

1925
01:57:41.389 --> 01:57:42.640
- Hey, Dave!
- Yo.

1926
01:57:43.391 --> 01:57:45.435
Lucky day. Head on down.

1927
01:57:46.060 --> 01:57:47.728
- Safe travels, buddy.
- Thanks.

1928
01:57:47.979 --> 01:57:49.313
I'll grab my gear.

1929
01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:51.065
Hey, where's Silva at?

1930
01:57:51.149 --> 01:57:52.483
- Over on D.
- Yeah?

1931
01:57:53.568 --> 01:57:55.048
I didn't think you were coming.

1932
01:57:55.153 --> 01:57:56.713
Figured you had something better to do.

1933
01:57:56.988 --> 01:57:58.406
Dude, I was.

1934
01:57:58.906 --> 01:58:02.076
Then there's all that "never leave
a brother SEAL behind" bullshit,

1935
01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:03.327
so here I am.

1936
01:58:04.412 --> 01:58:07.915
Long ride to the airport ahead of us.
I'll see what the hold-up is.

1937
01:58:12.670 --> 01:58:14.964
Hey, hey, hey!
Where the hell are you guys going?

1938
01:58:17.383 --> 01:58:18.968
Chickenshit!

1939
01:58:22.388 --> 01:58:23.389
Guys.

1940
01:58:29.228 --> 01:58:31.063
Did anyone else hear that?

1941
01:58:31.397 --> 01:58:33.566
<i>Guys, is that a mortar?</i>

1942
01:58:35.151 --> 01:58:36.591
<i>Mortars incoming. Get cover!</i>

1943
01:59:06.766 --> 01:59:09.060
I'm hit! I'm hit!

1944
01:59:21.405 --> 01:59:22.740
Oz, I'm coming!

1945
02:00:34.520 --> 02:00:36.272
Rone! Rone!

1946
02:00:49.785 --> 02:00:51.385
<i>This is Langley. Give us your stat.</i>

1947
02:00:51.621 --> 02:00:53.706
<i>You okay? Looks bad.</i>

1948
02:00:54.206 --> 02:00:55.625
<i>Bob, answer.</i>

1949
02:00:55.958 --> 02:00:57.960
Building A, what's going on? Check in.

1950
02:00:58.127 --> 02:00:59.795
<i>Get Deltas up on the roof now!</i>

1951
02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:01.714
Blue, blue. Going external.

1952
02:01:05.843 --> 02:01:07.011
Check that field to the west.

1953
02:01:11.474 --> 02:01:12.808
Jack, you believe this shit?

1954
02:01:13.059 --> 02:01:15.978
Stop. Stop, you're gonna
fuck it up even more.

1955
02:01:16.312 --> 02:01:17.647
All right. You ready?

1956
02:01:17.897 --> 02:01:19.649
1, 2, 3.

1957
02:01:21.317 --> 02:01:23.736
Jack, Jack. I tried, man.

1958
02:01:24.070 --> 02:01:25.446
Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it.

1959
02:01:25.529 --> 02:01:27.406
Let's get you out. Let's get you out.

1960
02:01:28.824 --> 02:01:30.242
Get me up.

1961
02:01:34.246 --> 02:01:35.581
Can you walk?

1962
02:01:35.748 --> 02:01:37.833
Yeah. Help me out. Help me out.

1963
02:01:39.001 --> 02:01:40.002
I'm coming!

1964
02:01:42.088 --> 02:01:44.215
Dave, Dave, hey, I'm on your side.
Don't shoot me.

1965
02:01:45.508 --> 02:01:48.010
It's okay, It's okay.
I got it, I got it!

1966
02:01:51.347 --> 02:01:52.390
I'll be right back. Yeah.

1967
02:01:52.515 --> 02:01:53.516
I want to live.

1968
02:01:53.683 --> 02:01:55.203
- Yeah. I'm coming right back.
- Don't!

1969
02:01:57.436 --> 02:01:58.979
My pistol, I need my pistol.

1970
02:01:59.063 --> 02:02:00.648
- Give me my pistol.
- Okay.

1971
02:02:01.607 --> 02:02:03.776
Here we go. Here we go.

1972
02:02:04.443 --> 02:02:07.154
Men are on the way, all right?
Hang in. Hang in.

1973
02:02:16.872 --> 02:02:18.207
Glen. Glen.

1974
02:02:42.481 --> 02:02:43.983
God, watch over him.

1975
02:02:44.734 --> 02:02:46.652
Guide him where he needs to be.

1976
02:02:46.986 --> 02:02:48.446
Take care of his family.

1977
02:03:19.143 --> 02:03:20.478
Chief.

1978
02:03:20.936 --> 02:03:22.772
Dave's hurt really bad.

1979
02:03:23.105 --> 02:03:24.774
Get somebody up there to see him.

1980
02:03:24.940 --> 02:03:27.526
Rone, we need you
in medical immediately. Over.

1981
02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:30.112
<i>Answer! Rone!</i>

1982
02:03:30.780 --> 02:03:32.406
Rone's not with us anymore.

1983
02:03:38.120 --> 02:03:39.789
Oz, how can I help?

1984
02:03:40.039 --> 02:03:41.373
Get me to medical.

1985
02:03:41.499 --> 02:03:43.167
<i>Dave's gonna bleed out fast
if you don't get up here.</i>

1986
02:03:43.292 --> 02:03:44.418
I'm gonna need some tourniquets.

1987
02:03:44.543 --> 02:03:45.903
Clear that table back there.

1988
02:03:48.464 --> 02:03:49.882
Put pressure on that wound.

1989
02:03:50.049 --> 02:03:51.717
Get me naked. Check for bleeds.

1990
02:03:51.801 --> 02:03:52.802
Okay.

1991
02:03:56.972 --> 02:03:58.974
Trauma shears, top shelf on the right.

1992
02:04:02.812 --> 02:04:04.452
Hey, hey, hey. Careful, careful, careful.

1993
02:04:04.480 --> 02:04:06.148
I don't want to get stabbed, too.

1994
02:04:16.158 --> 02:04:19.495
What are you doing? No! No, no, no!

1995
02:04:29.004 --> 02:04:30.714
Hey! It's not the time!

1996
02:04:33.676 --> 02:04:36.011
The enemy is still out there!

1997
02:04:37.179 --> 02:04:38.347
Let's go!

1998
02:04:43.519 --> 02:04:45.229
I called for air support.

1999
02:04:47.022 --> 02:04:48.607
It never came.

2000
02:04:51.068 --> 02:04:52.403
Show it to me.

2001
02:04:54.572 --> 02:04:55.906
I lost the Ambo, man.

2002
02:04:56.073 --> 02:04:57.658
Are you allergic
to morphine?

2003
02:04:57.908 --> 02:04:59.910
I lost the Ambo, Dave. What do I do?

2004
02:05:00.077 --> 02:05:01.912
Shut up and go get a gun on that door.

2005
02:05:02.246 --> 02:05:03.539
Now!

2006
02:05:10.838 --> 02:05:13.507
<i>You hear that, Boon?
You hear trucks?</i>

2007
02:05:30.524 --> 02:05:31.525
Chief.

2008
02:05:31.775 --> 02:05:33.861
<i>Are we expecting any friendlies?</i>

2009
02:05:35.279 --> 02:05:36.864
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

2010
02:05:37.781 --> 02:05:41.952
<i>I got 40, 50 vehicles,
including technicals.</i>

2011
02:05:42.786 --> 02:05:43.871
I don't know.

2012
02:05:45.122 --> 02:05:47.541
<i>It's over, guys. It's fucking over.</i>

2013
02:05:50.044 --> 02:05:52.504
A fucking massive heavy force.

2014
02:05:53.213 --> 02:05:54.715
Cock it, cock it.

2015
02:06:09.939 --> 02:06:13.943
As far as I'm concerned,
this isn't over till it ends.

2016
02:06:14.985 --> 02:06:17.738
That's when they're all dead or we are.

2017
02:06:40.010 --> 02:06:43.180
Oh, Lord! Oh, Jesus!

2018
02:06:43.639 --> 02:06:47.393
Guys, I think they're with us.

2019
02:06:47.476 --> 02:06:48.519
They're with us!

2020
02:06:50.145 --> 02:06:52.815
<i>They're with us!</i>

2021
02:07:10.165 --> 02:07:11.709
Oh!

2022
02:07:24.805 --> 02:07:26.181
Move, move!

2023
02:07:36.525 --> 02:07:38.736
It's not safe out here. Keep going.

2024
02:07:39.069 --> 02:07:41.739
Hurry! Get in the trucks!
They could still be coming.

2025
02:07:42.197 --> 02:07:44.033
Come on, guys, get in the trucks.

2026
02:07:45.534 --> 02:07:47.534
Come on. It's not safe out here.
Come on. Let's go.

2027
02:07:47.911 --> 02:07:49.913
Up, up, up! Please, please, please.

2028
02:07:50.539 --> 02:07:52.082
Come on, guys!

2029
02:08:18.275 --> 02:08:20.110
Chief, it's time.

2030
02:08:20.778 --> 02:08:22.488
No, I'm staying.

2031
02:08:22.571 --> 02:08:25.157
Sir, this is the last ride out.

2032
02:08:25.240 --> 02:08:28.702
Yeah, I know. I'm staying.
I've got Intel to collect.

2033
02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:31.121
Okay. Let's go!

2034
02:08:31.872 --> 02:08:33.457
What's the hold-up?

2035
02:08:33.874 --> 02:08:35.542
Your Chief, he won't exfil!

2036
02:08:35.709 --> 02:08:36.877
It's not safe out here!

2037
02:08:37.044 --> 02:08:38.378
- You what?
- I've got work to do.

2038
02:08:38.462 --> 02:08:39.797
I'm staying.

2039
02:08:39.880 --> 02:08:41.131
For what?

2040
02:08:41.715 --> 02:08:45.636
So that more guys like Ty and Glen
have to come back here?

2041
02:08:45.719 --> 02:08:47.554
And save your ass again?

2042
02:08:49.056 --> 02:08:50.557
You're done here.

2043
02:08:51.975 --> 02:08:54.561
Now, get in the fucking car!

2044
02:09:50.993 --> 02:09:51.994
Amahl.

2045
02:09:53.120 --> 02:09:54.538
We made it, man.

2046
02:09:55.539 --> 02:09:57.291
Come on, get in the truck.

2047
02:09:57.624 --> 02:09:58.959
- I'm going home.
- What?

2048
02:09:59.126 --> 02:10:01.378
I'm so sorry.
This should never have happened.

2049
02:10:04.006 --> 02:10:05.007
Hey.

2050
02:10:10.637 --> 02:10:12.597
Your country's
got to figure this shit out, Amahl.

2051
02:11:25.128 --> 02:11:27.256
I walked into this country,
I'm walking out.

2052
02:11:29.091 --> 02:11:30.133
Thank you.

2053
02:11:55.158 --> 02:11:57.119
I don't know how you survived all that.

2054
02:11:57.244 --> 02:11:59.204
But I know how the rest of us did.

2055
02:12:00.163 --> 02:12:01.623
You guys did well tonight.

2056
02:12:06.670 --> 02:12:08.547
I'm proud to know Americans like you.

2057
02:12:22.686 --> 02:12:24.813
Couple more hours till our plane.

2058
02:12:25.480 --> 02:12:27.065
Ambassador's body's just about here.

2059
02:12:30.694 --> 02:12:32.154
Hi, sir.

2060
02:12:32.654 --> 02:12:34.156
Can I have car?

2061
02:12:36.992 --> 02:12:38.160
Yeah.

2062
02:12:51.673 --> 02:12:53.175
There's no way.

2063
02:12:53.842 --> 02:12:56.303
No way those mortars
found us by chance.

2064
02:12:56.386 --> 02:12:58.388
Had to be set up on us
days or weeks ago.

2065
02:13:04.895 --> 02:13:06.021
Listen.

2066
02:13:08.982 --> 02:13:12.569
Any other 6 guys,
I don't think we'd make it.

2067
02:13:14.237 --> 02:13:16.865
I think we were meant
to be together last night.

2068
02:13:18.200 --> 02:13:20.000
How do you think
the Chief's eval is gonna go?

2069
02:13:21.036 --> 02:13:22.913
He's going to get a medal. You'll see.

2070
02:13:22.996 --> 02:13:24.081
And the Deltas?

2071
02:13:24.539 --> 02:13:27.042
Yep. Medals. All of them.

2072
02:13:28.085 --> 02:13:29.711
And what about us?

2073
02:13:31.254 --> 02:13:33.590
The odds were 1,000-to-1, easy.

2074
02:13:33.882 --> 02:13:35.008
What do we get?

2075
02:13:35.926 --> 02:13:37.511
We get to go home.

2076
02:14:08.875 --> 02:14:09.960
Libyan transport.

2077
02:14:11.628 --> 02:14:13.463
Still no Americans.

2078
02:14:14.965 --> 02:14:15.966
Hey.

2079
02:14:16.967 --> 02:14:18.301
It's me.

2080
02:14:21.138 --> 02:14:23.640
I wanted you to hear it from me first.
We had a...

2081
02:14:23.974 --> 02:14:25.809
A problem here.

2082
02:14:26.935 --> 02:14:30.814
Whatever you hear on the news,
it's over now.

2083
02:14:31.857 --> 02:14:33.191
I'm done.

2084
02:14:35.944 --> 02:14:38.029
I'm coming home.

2085
02:14:38.113 --> 02:14:39.489
For good.

2086
02:14:41.491 --> 02:14:42.617
No.

2087
02:14:43.285 --> 02:14:45.287
No, I'm just lucky. I...

2088
02:14:45.829 --> 02:14:47.455
I'm just lucky.

2089
02:14:53.670 --> 02:14:55.338
He didn't make it.

2090
02:15:00.677 --> 02:15:02.637
Rone's not coming home.

2091
02:15:11.313 --> 02:15:13.023
I love you so much.

2092
02:15:43.220 --> 02:15:46.473
<i>"All the gods, all the heavens,
all the hells are within you."</i>

2093
02:15:46.556 --> 02:15:48.600
<i>What is that?</i>

2094
02:15:48.683 --> 02:15:51.061
<i>Something Boon
dropped on me earlier.</i>

2095
02:15:51.144 --> 02:15:53.647
<i>It's just been rattling around
in my head all night.</i>
